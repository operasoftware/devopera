<p>In this example, we explicitly set the normal and bold version of the font family. As you see, this currently fails in Opera 10 due to a bug (which we're eagerly working on already) — the last <code>@font-face</code> block for a particular <code>font-family</code> overrides any previous definitions for the same family. In this case, the last <code>@font-face</code> block defines a bold font, rendering the whole element it is applied on in bold. Luckily, there is a <a href="http://devfiles.myopera.com/articles/751/webfonts-workaround.html">workaround</a> for this (temporary) problem.<p>

<h1>What does this mean in the real world?</h1>

<p>There are many beautiful and <strong>interesting fonts</strong> that can improve aesthetics and increase visual variety on the web. Just as I am sometimes stunned by beautiful book designs, I want to be <strong>overwhelmed by beautiful web pages</strong>. And, I don't want those beautiful pages to be made up of	background images.</p>
