<p>Hello everybody! I think I can speak for all Mac users when I say that I am really glad to see the final version of <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser">Opera 10.52 for Mac</a> released. The final version has been titled Opera 10.52, skipping a couple of point releases to make sure the final version is of the highest quality possible, and ensuring that, once again, the Mac and Win versions are aligned.</p>

<p>This version has been a long time in the works because it has undergone a complete rewrite into Cocoa, to further improve performance and give it a more native Mac feel with more Mac-like dialog boxes, trackpad gestures such as drag two fingers to scroll and pinch to zoom, and support for the Growl notification system.</p>

<p>This version has the following user agent string:</p>

<pre><code>Opera/9.80 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X; U; en) Presto/2.5.24 Version/10.52</code></pre>

<p>The browser also features super-fast rendering thanks to our Vega graphics library and Carakan JavaScript engine. If you want to experience the speed for yourself and compare it to other browsers, <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">install it</a> and then run the <a href="http://service.futuremark.com/peacekeeper/index.action">Peacekeeper tests</a>.</p>
