After a lucky 13 weekly builds on the [Desktop Team blog][1], we are extremely proud to present the first Beta release of Opera 9. If you recall [the second TP][2], we introduced the world to widgets in the browser, reintroduced ourselves to BitTorrent and said hello to a sophisticated content blocker. The Beta improves on all of those features with more widgets, better handling of Rich Text and several notable bug fixes. Of course BitTorrent, content blocker, site specific preferences, custom search engines all remain.

[Download][3] the beta and put it to the test. And [let us know][4] what you think and how we can improve. Of course, the usual caveats with Betas apply: Opera 9 Beta is not a final version and may contain bugs. Use it only on properly backed-up computers. [Read more about features][5] or [view the list of changes][6].
