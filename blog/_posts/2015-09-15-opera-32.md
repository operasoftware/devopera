Opera 32 (based on Chromium 45) for [Mac, Windows, and Linux](http://www.opera.com/computer) and [Android](http://www.opera.com/mobile/operabrowser/android) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2015/09/opera-32-privacy-is-a-universal-right-2/) and [Mobile](http://blogs.opera.com/mobile/2015/09/opera-32-add-to-home-screen/) blogs. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## ES6 arrow functions

Arrow functions enable a more succinct way of defining functions.

	const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
	// Let’s use the so-called fat arrow syntax:
	const squares = numbers.map(x => x * x);
	// This is equivalent to:
	const squares = numbers.map(function(x) {
		return x * x;
	});

They differ from regular function definitions in that their `this` and `arguments` objects, as well as the new `super` and `new.target` variables, are lexically bound.

Check out [Axel Rauschmayer’s post on arrow functions](http://www.2ality.com/2012/04/arrow-functions.html) for more information.

## ES6 array and `TypedArray` additions

The following ES6 array features are now available:

* [`Array.from`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.from)
* [`Array.of`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.of)
* [`Array.prototype.copyWithin`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.copyWithin)
* [`Array.prototype.fill`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.fill)
* [`Array.prototype.find`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.find)
* [`Array.prototype.findIndex`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-array.prototype.findIndex)

Furthermore, `TypedArray` subclasses such as `Int8Array` and `Float32Array` now support existing array methods such as `forEach` and `map`, as well as the abovementioned new methods.

## `Object.assign()`

The [`Object.assign()`](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-object.assign) function copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the modified target object. This enables easily merging objects or cloning them shallowly.

	const first = { 'name': 'Tony' };
	const last = { 'lastName': 'Stark' };
	const person = Object.assign(first, last);

	console.log(person);
	// → { 'name': 'Tony', 'lastName': 'Stark' };
	// Note: `first` was modified too!
	console.log(first);
	// → { 'name': 'Tony', 'lastName': 'Stark' };

	// To avoid mutating `first`, use this instead:
	const person = Object.assign({}, first, last);

## `Touch.rotationAngle`

[The Touch Events specification](https://w3c.github.io/touch-events/#touch-interface) defines a `rotationAngle` property for `Touch` instances. This value represents the rotation angle, in degrees, of the contact area ellipse defined by `radiusX` and `radiusY`.

## Reduced mouse position updates

While scrolling via trackpad or mousewheel, we previously sent mouse position updates every 100 milliseconds. Each mouse position update includes updating `:hover` styles, and dispatching `mousemove`, `mouseover`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`, and `mouseout` events. On pages with heavy mouse handlers or `:hover` styles, this could cause significant amounts of scroll jank.

To counter this, we no longer send mouse position updates while scrolling. Instead, we trigger this behavior 100 milliseconds after scrolling ends.

## Deprecated features

### MediaStream API

The following [MediaStream API](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/) features have been removed from the spec, and are now deprecated in Opera and Chrome:

* `MediaStream.prototype.label`
* `MediaStream.prototype.ended`
* `MediaStream.prototype.stop()` (deprecated in favor of `MediaStreamTracks.prototype.stop`)

### CSS / CSSOM

The `CSSUnknownRule` interface, which used to represent an unsupported at-rule, has been removed.

`CSSKeyframesRule.insertRule()` is deprecated in favor of `CSSKeyframesRule.appendRule()`.

[SMIL](http://www.w3.org/TR/smil-animation/) is now deprecated in favor of [CSS Animations](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-animations-1/) and [Web Animations](https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/).

### DOM

[DOM `Attr` instances](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-attr) (which represent attributes) now no longer have child nodes, matching the DOM spec.

The non-standard `compareNode()` and `expand()` methods on [the `Range` interface](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-range) have been removed.

`document.charset` is a non-standard IDL attribute supported by all engines except Gecko. [There is a proposal to standardize it.](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27436) In order to simplify standardization, `document.charset` has been made readonly, as a simple alias of `document.characterSet`.

Support for the `filterRes` attribute for `<filter>` elements has been removed in order to align with [the spec](https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/#element-attrdef-filter-filterres).

Finally, at [the Web Components F2F meeting in April 2015](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webapps/WebComponentsApril2015Meeting), it was decided that support for multiple shadow roots should be dropped from the spec. Chromium now logs a deprecation warning whenever an element hosts multiple shadow trees:

	const div = document.createElement('div');
	const shadowRoot1 = div.createShadowRoot();
	const shadowRoot2 = div.createShadowRoot();
	// Logs a deprecation warning.

Another result of that meeting is the deprecation of `>>>` / `/deep/` and `::shadow` pseudo-elements in [dynamic profile](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors/#dynamic-profile). When a `>>>` combinator (the shadow-piercing descendant combinator formerly known as `/deep/`) is encountered in a selector, Chromium now replaces every element in the selector match list with every element reachable from the original element by traversing any number of child lists or shadow trees.

## CSP2 `self`

In [Content Security Policy Level 2](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/content-security-policy/#source-list-guid-matching), the `'self'` source expression explicitly excludes the `blob:` and `filesystem:` schemes. If you wish to include content at those URLs in your pages, update your CSP directives to explicitly include those schemes.

## `CSSGroupingRule`

[The CSSOM `CSSGroupingRule` interface](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-cssgroupingrule-interface) represents an at-rule that contains other rules nested inside itself. Per spec, `CSSMediaRule` and `CSSPageRule` inherit from `CSSGroupingRule`.

## Service worker updates

### `Client.id`

We now support [the `id` property of a `Client` instance](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#client-id). Its value is a GUID allowing service workers to track client objects between termination and restart.

### `Client.postMessage` and `ServiceWorkerMessageEvent`

Before Chromium 45, a Service Worker sending a message via `Client.postMessage()` resulted in a `MessageEvent` fired on the `Client`’s global scope (e.g. `window`). Since Chromium 45, the event is a `ServiceWorkerMessageEvent` fired on `navigator.serviceWorker` rather than `window`. `Client.postMessage` is now no longer considered to be an experimental feature.

### `ServiceWorkerContainer.getRegistrations()`

[The `getRegistrations` method on `ServiceWorkerContainer` instances](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#navigator-service-worker-getRegistrations) returns all service worker registrations for the current origin.

### `ServiceWorkerRegistration.update()`

[The `update()` method on `ServiceWorkerRegistration` instances](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#service-worker-registration-update-method) pings the server for an updated version of this service worker registration without consulting caches.

## `NotificationOptions.vibrate`

[The Notifications API spec](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-notificationoptions-vibrate) defines a `vibrate` property on the `NotificationOptions` dictionary, which allows web developers to specify a vibration pattern for a notification.

## Subresource Integrity

[Subresource Integrity](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec/specs/subresourceintegrity/) defines a mechanism by which user agents may verify that a fetched resource has been delivered without unexpected manipulation. In a nutshell, metadata inlined as HTML attributes allows the browser to determine whether the resource that was downloaded matches the resource the page’s author expected to download. Chromium now supports SI for `<script>` and `<link rel="stylesheet">` elements.
