The number of web conferences on the calendar seems to be increasing with a wide choice of increasingly more specialised programs for web designers and developers to get their teeth into. One example that Opera is proud to support is the <a href="http://www.bdconf.com/" target="_blank">Breaking Development Conference</a>, due to take place from the 12th to 14th of September in Nashville, Tennessee.<br/><br/>This is the second time this conference has been held, with the first being held in Dallas. Its birth is a rather extreme example of the tendency of developers to scratch their own itch. Tim Kadlec, Jeff Bruss and their colleagues at <a href="http://colepublishing.com/" target="_blank">Cole Publishing</a> were looking to build a mobile version of their website but felt they lacked sufficient knowledge. They wanted to go beyond books and tutorials to personalised lessons, but found a lack of teachers so they went a step further - they invited a variety of experts to visit them and built a new conference around it.<br/><br/>Following on from the success of their first event, the upcoming conference in Nashville has an impressive list of speakers featuring experts from various areas of mobile web design and development.<br/><br/>Tickets for the workshops are sold out but tickets for the conference itself are still available until Saturday 10th September (no tickets will be sold on the day). <br/><br/>For more details see the <a href="http://www.bdconf.com/" target="_blank">Breaking Development conference website</a>, and if you&#39;re not able to attend, feel free to check out our <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/" target="_blank">tools such as the Opera Mobile emulator</a> and our <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/mobile/" target="_blank">mobile web articles and tutorials</a>.
