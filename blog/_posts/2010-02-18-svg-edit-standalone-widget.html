<p>Who says that widgets can only be used for small, trivial apps? Certainly not Developer Relations&#39; own Vadim Makeev, who took the open source, web-based, JavaScript-driven <a href="http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/">SVG-edit</a> project and turned it into an amazing standalone widget that can hold its own against traditional desktop applications.</p>
<p class="note">Widgets have been a part of Opera for a long time, but traditionally they required the browser to be running. In <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/">Opera 10.50 beta</a>, we effectively decoupled the widget engine, allowing for standalone widgets that install and run just like native applications.</p>

<p>Key features of the widget include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Comprehensive set of tools for vector drawing</li>
<li>Inclusion of raster graphics</li>
<li>Ability to load and save local SVG files</li>
<li>Layers (new in version 2.4)</li>
<li>User interface localization (with more languages planned for version 2.5)</li>
</ul>
