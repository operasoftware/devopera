<h3>UPDATE</h3>
<p>19 January 2009: This post contains  a formal response to a superseded consultation document. The <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=213">revised browser testing guidelines</a> are now available. The remainder of this post is  <strong> for historical purposes only</strong>.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is Opera Software&#39;s response to the <cite><a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/guidance.php?page=200">Public consultation on  browser standards for public sector Web sites</a></cite> by the United Kingdom&#39;s Central Office of  Information (<abbr>COI</abbr>).</p>
<p>Opera Software <abbr>ASA</abbr> is a company headquartered in Norway. Noway is  a signatory to the European Economic Area Agreement,  which  guarantees free trade with all EU states and  cooperation  in such  matters as consumer protection, culture, education, and information  services (see <a href="http://www.eu-norway.org/about/eeaforside.htm">http://www.eu-norway.org/about/eeaforside.htm</a>).</p>
<p>Many of our users are within the United Kingdom and the European  Union, and we feel that the draft guidelines (“the guidelines”)   potentially disadvantage them.</p>
<p>We support the aim of the <abbr>COI</abbr> to ensure inclusion by testing  public authority Web sites on  a range of browsers. It is also  laudable that the <abbr>COI</abbr> requires that Web sites be made accessible to  people with disabilities and across multiple operating systems. </p>
<p>However, we feel that there are some aspects of the browser   guidelines that need re-drafting. We request that our concerns be   considered  and give permission for them to be quoted with  attribution in any report on this consultation.</p>
<h3 id="summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>Opera believes that the current  guidelines attempt to reinvent a  wheel that has already been satisfactorily invented and refined over  time by other large organizations, both public and private. Reusing  their work  reduces costs to taxpayers.</p>
<p>Also, Opera believes that the guidelines in their current form </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#anti-competitive">are  	anti-competitive</a>, as they perpetuate dominance in the browser market  	by giving the impression that alternative browser products are  	inferior, and those who choose to use them are not worthy of  	consideration,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#inconvenience">inconvenience  	users</a> unnecessarily by asking them to install new software, </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#best-practice">do  	not promote best practice development</a> and may lead to <strong>more</strong> expensive development and testing,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#fragmented">are too fragmented</a>,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#devices">insufficiently  	“future-proof” Web sites</a>, by ignoring methodologies which would  	ensure compatibility with mobile phones and other devices,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#plugins">ignore  	plug-ins</a> which have capabilities independent of browsers, and</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><a href="#disabled">do  	not sufficiently ensure accessibility</a> by disabled users. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h4>
<p>The guidelines should recommend using  W<strong>eb standards</strong> and a  best-practice development methodology called “<strong>progressive  enhancement</strong>”.   This will help ensure compatibility across  browsers, rather than aiming at different  browsers as if they are  completely separate targets.</p>
<p>For testing, the guidelines should recommend adoption of browser  support matrices such as the one provided at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml</a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml">/</a> by the BBC, which is a well-respected Web brand with a  public-service duty and a huge, diverse audience.</p>
<p>This would support </p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>greater competition in the browser market</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>greater value for money for taxpayers</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>more consistency for Web visitors and developers, and </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>savings on Web development costs by promoting Web standards  	and proven methodologies.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits are also noted in the BBC&#39;s <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/technical/browser_support.shtml#appendix"><cite>Objectives of Web  browser support</cite></a>, which gives the methodology by which their  browser-support matrix was devised at Appendix 2.</p>
<h3 id="anti-competitive">Guidelines restrict choice</h3>
<h4>Guidelines confuse popularity with capability</h4>
<p>Paragraph 15 says “There may be specific browsers that you  choose not to fully support because they are either old or  unpopular.”</p>
<p>It is legitimate to choose not to support old browsers fully that  are not capable of rendering sites made with Web standards and  progressive enhancement.</p>
<p>However, it is  wrong to decide not to support a browser purely because it is  “unpopular”. If  it is capable of rendering the site, it should  be supported.</p>
<p>The guidelines&#39; introduction states, &quot;It  is important to declare which browsers your website has been tested  on. This demonstrates a clear commitment to your audience. Users will  want to know whether or not your website works with their browser.&quot; </p>
<p>We disagree. By naming the browsers on which  a Web site has been tested  (simply because they are more “popular”),  the impression is given that browsers that were not mentioned are  somehow “second class”, and its users are not worthy of  attention, which demonstrates a clear <em>lack</em> of commitment to  audience needs.</p>
<p>We recommend adopting a testing statement  such as  that used by the <a href="http://www.sra.org.uk/sra/accessibility.page">Solicitors Regulation Authority</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sra.org.uk/sra/accessibility.page">
    <p><strong>Browser compatibility</strong></p>
    <p>It doesn&#39;t matter how old your browser  is—you can use this website. It looks different in some older  browsers, and is mostly text in very old browsers (like Netscape 4,  or Internet Explorer for Macintosh). But the information is the same,  and so are the things you can do.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="inconvenience">Guidelines inconvenience users</h3>
<p>This erroneous impression of less “popular” browsers as being  inferior is reinforced in the sample “browser support statement”  in paragraph 12. </p>
<p>Webmasters are advised to list browsers they have tested in as  “<strong>supported</strong>”. The  example browser support policy statement  includes the message &quot;We advise you to upgrade your  browser version as far as your computer allows and if possible to one  of those listed above&quot;. </p>
<p>There are also many reasons why a user  may not be able to change their browser easily – for example, they</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p> may not be using their own computer and be on a shared  	computer; therefore, they are unable to change or update the  	browser,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> may use a particular browser because of security or privacy  	settings,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> may use a particular browser due to features that help them  	access and are unable to use another browser comfortably,</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p> may not know how to change their browser.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Many users of the most “popular  browser” made no conscious choice to use that browser. On the other  hand, we know that many Opera users choose Opera because of features  such as excellent keyboard support, the built-in voice browser,  intelligent zoom, and fit-to-width display, which are very useful for  people with disabilities. It is unreasonable and unfair to suggest  that they upgrade because a Webmaster has elected not to test in  Opera.</p>
<h4>Potentially anti-competitive</h4>
<p>Not only does this inconvenience the user, but we strongly believe  that this is anti-competitive.</p>
<p>The guideines help perpetuate current market shares by encouraging  users of “unsupported” (in reality, “untested”) browsers to  replace their current browser with another.</p>
<p>(Disclosure: The EU Commission are opening an investigation into  an anti-trust complaint filed by Opera on 12 December 2007, regarding  Microsoft bundling Internet Explorer in the Operating System and not  implementing Web standards.)</p>
<h3 id="best-practice">Guidelines do not promote best practices</h3>
<p>The guidelines  are published because it is “impractical and  inefficient” to test in all browsers. Presumably this should  be interpreted as the <abbr>COI</abbr> suggesting that it is not cost-effective to  do so.  However, it is unnecessary to do so if best-practice Web  development is followed.</p>
<h4>Best practices should be central to guidelines</h4>
<p>The section “out of scope” notes,  “How  to code for browser compatibility [and] Development methodologies  such as  graceful degradation and progressive enhancement,” are out of  scope<em>.</em> </p>
<p>Additionally,  paragraph 40 notes “These guidelines do not  advocate specific development methodologies, for example, <em>graceful  degradation </em>or <em>progressive enhancement</em>.  However, it is widely accepted that sites conforming to open Web  standards such as XHTML and CSS are more likely to work well across a  wide range of browsers. The importance  of working to technical standards  is highlighted in <em>Minimum  technical standards</em>”.</p>
<p>Opera  believes that  the guidelines <strong>must</strong> recommend the development methodology known as  “progressive enhancement” which, when based on Web standards,  would reduce inconsistencies between browsers resulting in greater  interoperability.</p>
<p>When this methodology is employed,  users of the most capable browsers automatically receive the highest  quality user experience, while users of less capable browsers will  receive content and be able to access basic functionality. Therefore,  no-one will be “locked out&quot;, whereas being &quot;locked out&quot;  is much more  likely if you choose consciously to test only  in/support specific browsers. </p>
<h4>Guidelines erroneously treat Web as a visual  medium</h4>
<p>The guidelines treat the Web as if it were a visual medium such as  print, in which designers specify pixel-perfect layout and can rely  on that being delivered to the consumer.</p>
<p>This is not true and is inappropriate for public-service websites,  where the emphasis is on content rather than aesthetics.</p>
<p>Paragraph 41 says, “A browser is <strong>semi-supported</strong> if the  content and navigation works but the website does not display as  intended”.</p>
<p>It is incorrect to judge a Web site on whether it displays “as  intended”. A Webmaster  cannot mark a browser “down” as  semi-supported because it does not have curved borders, opacity, or the same fonts as those on a designer&#39;s machine.</p>
<p>By emphasizing “intention”, the guidelines legitimize  preservation of design as a goal. In the past, this has led many bad  design decisions such as fonts being expressed  in pixel sizes which  cannot be resized in Internet Explorer, for example.</p>
<p>The Web site should be judged on  whether the <strong>recipient</strong> can  use it in a format that (s)he wishes. If, for example, a browser  mis-renders a site built with Web standards, such that content is  obscured or is illegible, then that browser is <strong>unsupported.</strong> </p>
<p>If a browser renders the content  as legible, the navigation usable and  functionality operable, then  that browser <strong>is fully supported</strong> in the context of a public-service site.</p>
<h4>Best practices lead to cost-savings</h4>
<p>Recommending best practices whereby  developers  code to internationally-agreed standards rather than to  circumvent the quirks of today&#39;s market leaders leads to  cost  savings throughout the life-cycle of a Web site:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>It is more cost-effective to build right than to correct  	during testing, so explicitly advocating progressive enhancement  	results in more efficient development and Web sites being quicker to  	market.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reducing inconsistencies through smarter development ensures  	that the “testing” phase is shorter and, in the case of static  	pages of content, it should be possible to reduce testing to a  	quicker “verification” stage that quickly checks across a range  	of browsers that there are no significant inconsistencies. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Once  	deployed, Web sites built using valid, semantic (X)HTML and CSS are  	more maintainable because they are in accordance with international  	standards. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="fragmented">Guidelines are too fragmented</h3>
<p>The guidelines  mention design methodology and minimum technical  standards in paragraph 40, but it is a leap of  faith to assume that everyone else will read the second document. </p>
<p>The  guidelines are written “for  all website managers, web developers and web testers delivering  public sector websites”, so we recommend that all the guidance  relevant to these groups be amalgamated —or  developers will naturally assume this supersedes all other guidance  and start developing to browsers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the “Minimum Technical  Standards” document is dated May 2002 and is obsolete; it  mentions  CSS 2 as the latest version, allows HTML tables for layout, and does  not mention Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).</p>
<p>Opera recommends modernizing this document and incorporating the  updated guidelines into a comprehensive document aimed at the target  audiences named on the cover. </p>
<h3 id="devices">Guidelines do not address mobile and other  devices</h3>
<p>Paragraph 39 notes that Guidance on support for mobile platforms  will be the subject of future guidance. Other devices are described  are similarly “out of scope”. (Paragraph 37 also notes, “Guidance  on support for mobile platforms will be the subject of future  guidance”; we assume this is an editorial error.)</p>
<p>This further fragments the guidelines, as readers will have  another set of guidelines to check.</p>
<p>Different guidelines are unnecessary. Recommending a progressive  enhancement methodology ensures that  Web pages work across all  browsers and devices.</p>
<h3 id="plugins">Guidelines ignore plug-ins which are independent  of browsers</h3>
<p>The guidelines ignore the subject of browser plug-ins, such as  those that allow readers to access <abbr>PDF</abbr>, <abbr>MP3</abbr>, video, and Flash  content. These plug into a browser but are independent of it.  Therefore, a group of users running the same version of a browser may  have different versions of plug-ins and receive markedly different  experiences.</p>
<p>For example, a visitor running Opera 9.5 with Flash Player 6 would  not be able to take advantage of any accessibility features built  into a Flash movie, while a visitor running Opera 8 with Flash Player  7 would be able to use those accessibility features, because the  plug-in has a higher specification, even though the browser is less  capable.</p>
<p>The guidelines should address plug-ins, independently from  browsers.</p>
<p>Opera also suggests that the guidelines for Web developers require  the use of open standards  wherever possible, while allowing content  that requires plug-ins as a secondary delivery method.</p>
<h3 id="disabled">Guidelines should recommend testing by disabled  users</h3>
<p>Opera welcomes the guidelines&#39;  inclusion of a requirement that Web sites be tested with assistive  technologies. </p>
<p>However, the guidelines currently  legitimize a sighted developer using a trial version of a  screenreader and comparing the synthesized speech with the words on a  screen, which is inadequate testing; a sighted user cannot have the  same experience or knowledge of the tool as a real user. </p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that it should  incorporate guidance from the British Standards Institution&#39;s  Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 78, <cite><a href="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publicationsandresources/Disability/Pages/Websiteaccessibilityguidance.aspx">Guide  to good practice in commissioning accessible websites</a></cite>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publicationsandresources/Disability/Pages/Websiteaccessibilityguidance.aspx">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>“All  	organizations, regardless of size, should ensure that those testing  	the website are different from those developing it.”</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>“Website  	commissioners should conduct user testing with disabled participants  	to ensure that their websites are accessible and usable by disabled  	people”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>User  	testing should include users from a range of disabilities and  	preferences, including a mix of beginners and experienced web users  	using a range of assistive technologies.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="amiguities">Inadequate definitions/ ambiguities</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Paragraph 46 suggests testing “ability to bookmark” as  	part of testing a Web site. That is a browser feature, not a  	developer-authored feature and thus out-of-scope.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Why are Rich Internet Applications separated out? The  	requirement for  sites to work with scripting turned off, etc., is  	not  solely related to <abbr>RIA</abbr>s.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trademarks">Too many trademarks used in examples</h3>
<p>We would prefer it if more than one trademark were used as  illustrative examples, or none at all, as  currently the guidelines  erroneously give the impression  that only one browser exhibits the  qualities being discussed. </p>
<p>For example, we would prefer it if paragraph 50 were redrafted to  read, “Certain browsers (e.g., Firefox and Opera) are developed  using cross-platform technology (e.g., Java) and, therefore, behave  similarly on different operating systems,” or “Certain browsers   are developed using cross-platform technology ...”.</p>
