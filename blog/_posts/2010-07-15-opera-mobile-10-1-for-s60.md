This is a truly busy summer (or winter, depending where you are). Following the release of <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/just-out-opera-mini-5-1-for-android"> Opera Mini 5.1 for Android</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mobile 10.1 Beta for S60</a> is coming to town, and with it we want to share with you some exciting new features.
</p>

<h3>Vega</h3>
<p>
Opera’s graphic library Vega is turned on in this version. This means that CSS3 support such as <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-transitions-and-2d-transforms/">2D Transforms</a>, <code>border-radius</code>, <code>border-image</code>, and <code>box-shadow</code> now work on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S60_(software_platform)">Symbian S60</a> phones.
</p>

<h3>Carakan</h3>
<p>
Our JavaScript engine has boosted speed greatly on Opera desktop, you can see how much <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/opera-10-5-pre-alpha-build-released-here-is-whats-new">difference it made when we moved to Carakan on the desktop in Opera desktop 10.50</a>. Now it&#39;s Opera Mobile&#39;s turn to feel the speed. However, please note that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation" title="Just In Time">JIT</a> compilation in Carakan is not available in this version.
</p>

<h3>Geolocation</h3>
<p>
We have heard time and again that geolocation has the best use case on mobile phone. It is our privilege to bring the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/how-to-use-the-w3c-geolocation-api/">W3C Geolocation API</a> to S60 phones. Developers can now build awesome websites that make use of this wonderful web standard, on desktop and mobile phones.
</p>
<h3>…for developers, a standards chart</h3>
<p>
Also, we know that developers have been asking for a quick and easy reference to the various Opera products standards support. So now you have it, <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/productspecs/">a table listing HTML5, CSS3, Storage, Graphics and other standards support on Opera Desktop, Opera Mobile and Opera Mini</a>.
<p>
<h3>Thanks!</h3>
<p>
