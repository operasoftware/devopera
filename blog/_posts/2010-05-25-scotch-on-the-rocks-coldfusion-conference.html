<p><h2>ColdFusion conference, May 24 2010, London</h2>

<p>This was definitely a new and weird experience for me — attending and speaking at a ColdFusion conference, about HTML5 and CSS3! I had a lot of fun playing around with ColdFusion around a decade ago, but since then (after getting into all things front end, and shying away from server-side experimentation) I don&#39;t think I&#39;d even heard the word uttered more than a handful of times. Until last year that is, when I met some ColdFusion developers at a conference in Australia, and they filled me in on the underground phenomenon of ColdFusion&#39;s popularity in Enterprise and Government.</p> ... </p><!--more--><p>And now I get invited to speak at a &lt;cfconference&gt; (see? getting into it already.) When I got there it was nice to chat to some familair faces from the Flash world, like Aral Balkan, John Davey and Mike Jones. I also met some new people, like organisers Andy (Allan) and Matt (Gifford). In short, I had a great time. The CF folk are just as passionate and driven as the rest of us webbies, and they made me feel very welcome.</p>

<p>I watched an Adobe CF keynote and a talk on AIR application development using CF, which I didn&#39;t understand much of but found very interesting. It was then time for my talk — I really wasn&#39;t sure how it would go down, but the organisers assured me that HTML5 was a very requested topic at this conference. I was pleased to see that the room was absolutely packed (about 200), and people asked some really good questions all the way through. I had plenty of opportunities to plug Opera throughout, and my book, and my educational initiatives! I spent a good few hours afterwards talking to people about HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

<p>After lunch, I hung around to watch Aral Balkan&#39;s fantastic talk on emotional user experience (the guy is a fantastic, really engaging speaker!), and then I said my goodbyes, as I wasn&#39;t feeling too well, and wanted to drop by the London web standards meetup quickly to say hi to Henny Swan and Chris Magro, Jim O&#39;Donnell, Ian Pouncey, Jeff Van Campen, and others, before heading back off to Manchester. A great time was had by all!</p>
