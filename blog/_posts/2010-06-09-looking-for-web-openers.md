<p>At Opera Software, we believe that the Web should stay open and free to all users, regardless of which browser they are using. Therefore we are fighting for One Web, open Web standards, and we are looking for an
enthusiastic, passionate individual to join the Developer Relations team!</p>
<p>We are looking for <strong>Web Openers</strong> who will help promote cross-browser coding practices, making the Web available to everyone on any device.</p>
<p>Based on feedback from users, testers and engineers you will contact large as well as smaller Web sites and advise them on how to improve their code for maximum compatibility and device independence. You must have insights into the underlying technology, excellent communication skills, and a deep understanding of the commercial and social aspects of the Web.</p>
<p>The job also involves providing support for Web developers, Opera’s developer customers and its internal engineers through community evangelism, developer outreach, and networking.</p>
