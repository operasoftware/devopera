<p>I was privileged to be invited to come and present at London Web Standards, and honoured that the tickets sold out within 45 minutes of being available. So, no pressure then ...</p>

<p>Assisted by the lovely Henny who advanced my slides and alt-tabbed from slideshow to demo, I sneezed and snuffled my way through a presentation called <a href="http://people.opera.com/brucel/talks/2009/LondonWebStandards-html5.pdf"><abbr>HTML</abbr>5 and Friends (<abbr>PDF</abbr>, 723K)</a>.</p>

<p>The resources that I demoed were</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://canvaspaint.org/">Canvas Paint</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.benjoffe.com/code/demos/canvascape/"><code>canvas</code> first-person shooter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://htmlfive.appspot.com/static/gifter.html"><code>canvas</code> first-person gifter</a></li>
<li><a href="http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/">the excanvas library to port <code>canvas</code> to Internet Explorer</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/jquery_visualize_plugin_accessible_charts_graphs_from_tables_html5_canvas/">Filament Group&#39;s jQuerty plugin using <code>canvas</code> for graphing data tables</a></li>
<li><a href="http://raphaeljs.com/">Raphaël JavaScript Library to make <abbr>SVG</abbr> that also works in Internet Explorer</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/svgweb/">SVG Web is a JavaScript library which provides SVG support on Internet Explorer</a> (alpha code: not ready for production)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://people.opera.com/brucel/demo/html5-forms-LWS-demo.html">My <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 forms demo, including range, date, regex validation</a></li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.modernizr.com">modernizr</a> - a small <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 capability detection library</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also <a href="http://www.opera.com/">download Opera 10</a> which I was using to demo.</p>

<p>Opera Developer Network has some beginner&#39;s <code>canvas</code> tutorials available:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html-5-canvas-the-basics/">HTML 5 canvas - the basics</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/html5-canvas-painting/">Creating an HTML 5 canvas painting application</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/creating-pseudo-3d-games-with-html-5-can-1/">Creating pseudo 3D games with HTML 5 canvas and raycasting</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/3d-games-with-canvas-and-raycasting-part/">Creating pseudo 3D games with HTML 5 canvas and raycasting: Part 2</a></li>
</ol>

<p>For the second half of the talk, I built an <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 page through the magic of live coding (with lavish prizes!).</p>

<p>Consequently there are no slides to publish, but I have an article called <a href="http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/">Designing a blog with <abbr>HTML</abbr></a> that covers the same ground. (Two articles on my personal blog cover it in much more detail: <a href="/2009/redesigning-with-html-5-wai-aria/">Redesigning with HTML 5 and WAI-ARIA</a> and <a href="/2009/marking-up-a-blog-with-html-5-part-2/">Marking up a blog with HTML 5 (part 2)</a>.)</p>

<p>The shocking looseness of <abbr>HTML</abbr>5&#39;s validation rules is discussed in an article I wrote called <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html-5-xml-xhtml-5/">HTML 5 + XML = XHTML 5</a>. The main take-home should be that, although you can mix quoted or unquoted attributes, upper and lower case freely (even in the same page), you shouldn&#39;t: if you do, you&#39;ll make your code an unreadable and therefore unmaintainable mess. Choose one coding convention that works for you and stick to it.</p>

<p>Some other useful resources:</p>

<li>the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec-author-view/">author&#39;s version of the <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 specification</a> (much shorter than the main version and generated from the same source, but without all the parsing rules and algorithms for browser manufacturers and other implementors)</li>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to all who attended and asked great questions. I&#39;m sorry that I had to charge off before the bar shut (not like me at all!) but my son was sick so I needed to get the last train home.</p>
