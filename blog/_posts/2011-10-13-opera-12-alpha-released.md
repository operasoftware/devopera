Our development team has been hard at work readying the next version of Opera. We&#39;re proud to announce the release of <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/" target="_blank">Opera 12.00 alpha</a>, which is packed with all sorts of lovely things. Here&#39;s what&#39;s new.<br/><ul class="bullets"><li> <strong>Lightweight Themes:</strong> Opera 12.00 introduces lightweight themes. We introduced our Featherweight interface with Opera 11.50, and with Opera 12.00 we have introduced a simplified theme development mechanism. Read Chris Mills&#39; dev.opera article about <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/operas-lightweight-themes/" target="_blank">developing lightweight themes</a> for more.</li><li> <strong>HTML5 Parser:</strong> Opera 12.00 is our first official release to ship with <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/show.dml/26453141" target="_blank">Ragnar&#xF6;k</a>, our HTML5 parser. The HTML5 specification details <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/parsing.html#parsing" target="_blank">specific rules</a> for handling markup, particularly malformed markup. These rules help impose a consistent DOM across browsers. Ragnar&#xF6;k means that improperly closed tags (such as <code>&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; /&gt;</code>), and mis-nested tags will no longer break pages or the DOM.</li><li> <strong>Radial Gradients:</strong>  Yep, another <strong>huge</strong> addition to Opera. We now have full support for CSS3 <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-images/#radial-gradients" target="_blank">radial gradients</a>, including explicit shape settings and multiple keywords. Millsy again has you covered with another dev.opera article &#x2014; about <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-radial-gradients/" target="_blank">CSS3 radial gradients</a>.</li><li> <strong>WebGL:</strong> Before <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/" target="_blank">WebGL</a>, 3D in the browser required a plug-in to produce any kind of reasonable experience, which was further stunted by lack of processing power. But browsers &#x2014; including Opera &#x2014; have now caught up. With our WebGL-enabled build, which draws directly upon the power of your graphics card, you can now create powerful 3D rendering, directly inside the browser! Learn more <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/an-introduction-to-webgl/" target="_blank">about WebGL</a> at dev.opera with our newest Dev Rel team member, Luz Caballero.</li><li> <strong>Hardware Acceleration:</strong> As hinted above, Opera 12.00 also includes hardware acceleration, which serves to save 3D graphics from a slow death. And as a bonus, 2D <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> rendering and animations also get a performance boost.</li><li> <strong>Full ES5.1 Support:</strong> We&#39;ve also implemented support for the ECMAScript 5.1 specification. In addition to it, we also now have native implementation of ECMAScript typed arrays. We have previously blogged about it <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2011/09/13/es5" target="_blank"> on the Opera Desktop Team Blog</a> and on the <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2011/09/13/ecmascript-5-for-opera" target="_blank">ODIN Blog</a> as well, which you can read to find out more information on it.</li></ul><br/><br/>Previously-mentioned improvements featured in Opera 12.00 alpha include <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2011/09/29/what-s-new-in-opera-development-snapshots-28-september-2011-edition" target="_blank">support for <tt>rem</tt> units</a> and a fix for a <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2011/10/07/opera-snapshot-7-october-2011" target="_blank"><code>&lt;style&gt;</code> parsing bug</a>. <br/><br/><strong>KNOWN ISSUE</strong>: You may find that (repeating) radial gradients render oddly, or not at all in this build. We have discovered a bug whereby our hardware acceleration clashes with radial gradients. We are aiming to get it fixed by the next release.
