It&#39;s not just Opera Mini, but the whole Mobile Web.
</p>

<p>
As shown by <a href="http://www.opera.com/smw/" target="_blank">State of the Mobile Web Report</a>, Indonesians&#39; average page view is 400 odd pages and they also enjoy the second biggest Opera Mini user base after Russia.
</p>

<p>
So why is the Mobile Web booming?
<p />

<ol>
<li>
<b>Cheap access</b>. There are more than 10 telcos pitting against each other and each one offers good pricing. On average you pay about USD0.10/Mb.
</li>
<li>
<b>Bad landlines</b>. The Mobile Web is the perfect substitution for an unsatisfactory landline experience.
</li>
<li>
<b>The Berry factor</b>. The mass appeal for BlackBerry and its push email application meant that going online became part of the &quot;Berry craze&quot;.
</li>
<li>
<b>Traffic jams</b>. During rush hour, what better to do than to surf the web?
</li>
</ol>

I&#39;ve presented the case in <a href="http://files.myopera.com/onlyputri/files/diskusipanel.jpg" target="_blank">The New Wave of Mobile Internet</a>, Universitas Krisdwipayana and the <a href="http://freshyourmind.com/" target="_blank">FreSh</a> forum.
