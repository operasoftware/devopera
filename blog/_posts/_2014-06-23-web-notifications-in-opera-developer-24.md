With the newest release of Opera 24 (which we have also [released on Linux](http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2014/06/opera-24-linux-released-developer-stream/) now), we have added support for [Web Notifications](http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/). 

Now, Web Notifications was already there in the chromium project for quite some time, so why did it take us time to add it? Well, the way chromium deals with notifications makes it seem non-native - we wanted to make it feel native on all our platforms, and we worked on it to make it happen.

So the notifications you have on Opera will feel like native notifications (i.e, however your operating system displays notifications - whichever your platform is). We beleive this is a much better experience for users. 

A very simple notification on the mac platform would look like this

You can of course, include an image as well, like so:

To give you a quick overview of web notitifcations, it's really quite simple. The first thing you need check if the browser supports notifications, if so, to ask the user for permission to show notifications. 

You can do this by the writing something like the following: 

<pre><code>if ('Notification' in window) {
	Notification.requestPermission(function() {});
}</code></pre>
		

If permission is granted by the user, then you can proceed to display a notification, like so:

<pre><code>if (notification.permission == 'granted') {
var firstNotification = new Notification("Sample Notification", {body: "This is a sample notification."});
}
</code></pre>

You can add in other parameters in too, like an icon:

<pre><code>if (notification.permission == 'granted') {
var firstNotification = new Notification("Sample Notification", {icon: "icon.png", body: "This is a sample notification."});
}
</code></pre>

Apart from the `body` and `icon` attributes, you also have the `dir` and `tag` attribute available. The former is about specifying the direction of the text in the notification. The latter, `tag` is about specifying that particular type of notification. For example, if you have a social networking site open in two seperate tabs and you get a new message from your friend - it shouldn't happen that both tabs produce notification about the same thing. So if the notifications share the same tag, then multiple instances of it will be counted as one - thus you will only get the notification one time, no matter how many pages of the site you have open in different tabs. 

##Working with notification events

The most common thing you would do is to do something when a person clicks on a notification. The `onclick` method is used to capture this and perform an actions. 

<pre><code>var testNotification = new Notification("Sample Notification", {body: "This is a sample notification."});

testNotification.onclick = function(){
	console.log("onclick worked");
}
</code></pre>

Similarly, you have the `onerror`, and the `onshow` methods. 

Notifications dramitically increase the usefullness of certain apps, especially ones dealing with email and social networking (some of the biggest sites in the world fall into this category). We hope you'll like the native-like notifications that Opera provides to web apps. Cheers!
