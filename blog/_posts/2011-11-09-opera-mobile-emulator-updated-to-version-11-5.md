<p>I&#39;m happy to announce that we have updated the <a href="http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mobile/">Opera Mobile Emulator</a> to version 11.5, to match the most recent version of <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mobile</a> available on <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.opera.browser">Android</a>, S60 and MeeGo devices.</p>

<p>New in this version are a revamped horizontal launch panel with fresh device presets, extra command line hooks, and a whole range of fixes and improvements – most prominent for many developers, the issue of doing a &quot;local&quot; remote debugging session with <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly">Opera Dragonfly</a> on Mac and Linux using the standard <code>127.0.0.1</code> address has now been fixed (though, at the time of writing, it will require the use of <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/next/">Opera Next</a> or the latest <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/">Opera 11.60 snapshot</a>).</p>
<p>For all details, have a look at our <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mobile-emulator/"><cite>Opera Mobile Emulator for desktop</cite> guide on Dev.Opera</a>. Let us know what you think, and be sure to spread the word!</p>
