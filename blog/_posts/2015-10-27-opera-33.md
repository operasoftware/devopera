Opera 33 (based on Chromium 46) for [Mac, Windows, and Linux](http://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see [our Desktop blog](http://blogs.opera.com/news/2015/10/the-new-o-has-landed-on-opera-for-computers/). Here’s what it means for web developers.

## `<link rel=preconnect>`

[The Resource Hints standard](https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/) defines `<link rel="preconnect" href="…">` as a hint that the browser should predictively open a connection to the supplied server for resources that will be needed later in the loading process.

## `<iframe sandbox="allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox">`

[The `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox` flag](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#attr-iframe-sandbox-allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox) for `<iframe sandbox="…">` allows a sandboxed document to spawn new windows without forcing the sandboxing flags upon them, hence creating a clean browsing context. For example, a third-party advertisement can be safely sandboxed without forcing the same restrictions upon a landing page. [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox/)

## `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-modals">`

From now on, sandboxed frames block modal dialogs (such as those caused by `window.alert()`, `window.confirm()`, `window.print()`, and `window.prompt()`) by default to prevent them from popping up confusing messages to users.

If you really want to allow modal dialogs inside a sandboxed frame, add [`allow-modals`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#attr-iframe-sandbox-allow-modals) to its `sandbox` attribute. [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/block-modal-dialogs-sandboxed-iframe/)

## ES6 `new.target`

[`new.target`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-meta-properties-runtime-semantics-evaluation) is an implicit parameter that all functions have. It is to constructor calls as `this` is to method calls:

* Inside of a constructor, `new.target` is a reference to the constructor that was used when calling `new`.
* Inside of a normal function, `new.target` is `undefined`.

This is useful for distinguishing at runtime whether code is being executed as a constructor or as a function. `new.target` may also be used as a way to determine the specific subclass that was used with `new` from within a superclass constructor. [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/new-target-es6/)

## ES6 spread operator

The ES6 spread operator `...` turns the elements of an array into the arguments of a function call or into elements of another array.

	// Date of the Opera 33 release.
	new Date(...[2015, 9, 20]);

	// Or…
	const dateParts = [2015, 9, 20];
	new Date(...dateParts);

For more information, read [Axel Rauschmayer’s explanation of the spread operator](http://www.2ality.com/2015/01/es6-destructuring.html#the_spread_operator_%28...%29).

## `new DOMException(message, errorName)`

[`DOMException`](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-DOMException)s can now be programmatically created as follows:

	throw new DOMException('The operation could not be compeleted', 'AbortError');

The first parameter is a custom error message; the second parameter is a value taken from [the table of `DOMException` error names](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-DOMException-error-names).

## Trusted events

[The `isTrusted` read-only property](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-istrusted) of an `Event` instance is `true` when the event was generated by a user action such as mouse click, and `false` when the event was scripted or invoked via `dispatchEvent`.

This is primarily useful for browser extensions, to determine if an event was dispatched by a script running in the main world or not.

[A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/event-istrusted/)

## `history.scrollRestoration`

By default, browsers restore the scroll position when a user traverses history.
This behavior works well for document-style web sites but it is often not
appropriate for single-page web applications where the page content may be
reconstructed (often asynchronously) upon navigation and where the
application wants to control the details of visual transition between UI states.

[The new `history.scrollRestoration` API](https://majido.github.io/scroll-restoration-proposal/history-based-api.html) makes it possible to disable this default scroll restoration behavior, as follows:

	history.scrollRestoration = 'manual';

This leaves the web developer in full control over any scroll changes that may be required when a user traverses the app’s history.

For more details, see [Paul Lewis’ blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/history-api-scroll-restoration).

## WebRTC `bufferedamountlow` event

[The `bufferedamountlow` event](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#event-datachannel-bufferedamountlow) makes it possible to monitor WebRTC data channel buffers. This allows pages to use WebRTC data channels for high-throughput applications more efficiently and conveniently, by removing the need to use timer-based polling for output buffer management.

## `CSS.escape(string)`

[`CSS.escape(string)`](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom/#the-css.escape%28%29-method) serializes `string` as a CSS identifier. This enables developers to easily and securely do things like escaping a string for use as part of a selector. [Check out the demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-escape/), and [use the polyfill](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/CSS.escape) to maintain compatibility with browsers that don’t implement this yet.

## CSS intrinsic sizing

The [CSS Intrinsic & Extrinsic Sizing Module](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/) extends the CSS sizing properties with the following keywords:

* [`fill`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-fill)
* [`fit-content`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-fit-content)
* [`max-content`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-max-content)
* [`min-content`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-3/#valdef-width-min-content)

These keywords represent content-based “intrinsic” sizes and context-based “extrinsic” sizes, allowing CSS to more easily describe boxes that fit their content or fit into a particular layout context. [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-intrinsic-sizing/)

## Cache API updates

The [Cache API](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#cache-storage-match) as available in `window` contexts, web worker contexts, and service workers contexts is now restricted to secure origins (such as HTTPS) only.

[The `addAll` method on `Cache` instances](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#cache-addAll) takes an array of `RequestInfo` objects, fetches them, and adds the response objects into the `Cache` object.

## Fetch API updates

[Chromium 44 / Opera 31 added support for `Request.prototype.context`](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-31/#requestprototypecontext) which has since been [dropped](https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/93) from the spec. To match the spec, support for this feature has been removed in Chromium 46 / Opera 33 after being deprecated in Chromium 45 / Opera 32.

The Fetch API also defines [a `redirect` setter on `Request` instances](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-redirect-mode) that tells the browser how to treat redirect responses (i.e. HTTP status codes `301`, `302`, `303`, `307`, or `308`). This setter is now supported. It accepts the following values:

* `'follow'` — follow any redirect responses;
* `'error'` — treat a redirect response as an error;
* `'manual'` — don’t follow the redirect, and return an [opaque-redirect filtered response](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-filtered-response-opaque-redirect) which wraps the redirect response.

## HTTP Client Hints

`DPR`, `Width`, and `Viewport-Width` hints enable proactive content negotiation between client and server, enabling automated delivery of optimized assets — e.g. auto-negotiating image DPR resolution, image size, and other optimized assets based on signals such as the client’s viewport width. For more details, see [the list of use cases](https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints#use-cases).

Note that HTTP Client Hints can be used [alongside](https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints#picture-element) [the `<picture>` element](https://dev.opera.com/articles/responsive-images/) to automate resolution switching, simplify art direction, and automate delivery of variable-sized images.

## HTTP Public Key Pinning reporting

HTTP Public Key Pinning, or HPKP, is a standard that allows websites to send an HTTP header instructing the browser to remember (or “pin”) parts of its TLS certificate chain. The browser then refuses subsequent connections that don’t match the pins that it has previously received.

HPKP reporting can be used to detect misconfigurations as you’re rolling out HPKP. The Google Developers blog has [a very good explanation](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/HPKP-reporting-with-chrome-46) of how this works.

## Performance Timeline API updates

The [Performance Timeline APIs](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/) (`performance.*`) were previously only available in `window` contexts. Now they are available in web worker contexts and service workers contexts as well.

[Resource Timing-specific extensions](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#extensions-performance-interface) now work without the `webkit` prefix.

Additionally, [the `workerStart` property on `PerformanceResourceTiming` instances](https://w3c.github.io/resource-timing/#widl-PerformanceResourceTiming-workerStart) is now supported.

## Service worker updates

[The `matchAll()` method on `Clients` instances](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#clients-matchall-method) now returns the clients in most-recently-focused order, matching the spec.

The `update()` method on `ServiceWorkerRegistration` instances (which shipped in Chromium 45 / Opera 32) pings the server for an updated version of this service worker registration. In Chromium 46 / Opera 33, it now returns a promise that resolves with `undefined` if the operation completed successfully or if there was no update, and rejects if `update` failed. If the new worker ran but installation failed, the promise still resolves.

## Proprietary codecs in Web Audio API

Opera now supports proprietary Web Audio API codecs. It is now possible to [decode MP3s](http://jxnblk.com/stepkit/), for example, if your system supports it.

## What’s next?
