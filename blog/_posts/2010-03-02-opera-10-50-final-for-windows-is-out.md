<p>This morning, we&#39;ve released the much anticipated <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">final version of Opera 10.50</a> for Windows — work on Mac and Linux versions is still ongoing, so <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/">stay tuned</a>.</p>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, we&#39;ve gradually lifted the veil on new features and standards support, but here are a couple of highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super-fast JavaScript with <strong><a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2009/12/22/carakan-revisited">Carakan</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Our <strong>Vega</strong> graphics engine, which adds support for <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-border-background-boxshadow/">CSS3 Backgrounds and Borders</a>, <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/css3-transitions-and-2d-transforms/">Transitions and 2D Transforms</a> and much more.</li>
<li><strong>HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code></strong>: Bruce and Patrick have written an <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/introduction-html5-video/">introductory article</a> and done a <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/accessible-html5-video-with-javascripted-captions/">JavaScripted based captions experiment</a>. There&#39;s also a superbly detailed article by Simon Pieters, who works in Quality Assurance for HTML5 video and audio at Opera, called <a href="http://my.opera.com/core/blog/2010/03/03/everything-you-need-to-know-about-html5-video-and-audio-2">Everything you need to know about HTML5 video and audio</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Web Storage</strong>: Shwetank&#39;s <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/web-storage/">article on Local and Session storage</a> was just published today. Web SQL is supported as well — we have an article in the pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Standalone Opera Widgets</strong>: widgets can now be run as standalone applications with or without native chrome, which means you can effectively build cross-platform apps using Web Standards. If you want to play around with this, have a look at our newly released <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15552/">eBook Reader</a>, a <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15592/">Unite Media Player</a>, or Vadim&#39;s <a href="http://widgets.opera.com/widget/15321/">SVG-Edit</a> app. For more info, check out Daniel&#39;s <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/widgets-updated-with-opera-10-50">recent Widgets post</a>.</li>
<li>An <strong>&quot;Inspect Element&quot;</strong> menu option that allows you to immediately analyze any element on a page. David has posted an overview of all changes in our debugging tools on the <a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/opera-dragonfly-alpha-for-presto-2-5">Opera Dragonfly blog</a>.</li>
<li>A <strong>revamped menu structure</strong>: especially note the Developer Tools menu (under Opera → Page), which includes Opera Dragonfly, Source, Page Info and more.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 7 tricks</strong>: Aero Peek, Jump List support and Aero Glass effects.</li>
<li>And last but not least, the <code>@font-face</code> issues we&#39;ve had in the <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2010/02/11/opera-10-50-beta-is-out">past</a> are now resolved :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those interested, there is a <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/1050/">extensive changelog</a> available in the Documentation section on the (renewed) Opera site.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t done so, <strong>grab Opera 10.50 from <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">our site</a></strong>, and let us know what you think!</p>
