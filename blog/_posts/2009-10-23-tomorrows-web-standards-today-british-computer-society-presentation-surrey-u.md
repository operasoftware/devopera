<p>I had the pleasure of speaking to a really savvy crowd at Surrey University last night on &quot;Tomorrow&#39;s web standards today&quot;.  It was a fun session with lots of really good questions at the end - just the way I like it.</p>

<p>Below are my slides written in HTML. They&#39;re best viewed in Opera on full screen (View &gt; Full screen) but of course work in any browser.Demos for <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, web forms, widgets and media queries are all either linked from the presentation or bundled together in the download.</p>
