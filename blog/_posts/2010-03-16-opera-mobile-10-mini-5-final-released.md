<p>Earlier today, we&#39;ve released the final versions of <a href="http://www.opera.com/mobile/">Opera Mobile 10 and Opera Mini 5</a>. Both are totally free, so be sure to download them to your phone!</p>
<p>Opera Mobile 10 is available for Windows Mobile and Nokia smartphones, and Opera Mini 5 will work on any phone with Java, as well as on BlackBerry phones. For Android and Windows Mobile, we even have native (beta) versions of Mini. Just visit <a href="http://m.opera.com">m.opera.com</a> and you&#39;ll get the available download options for your device.</p>
<p>For the occasion, we&#39;ve prepared two <a href="http://dev.opera.com/">Dev.Opera</a> articles: a first one covers <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mini-5-developers/">developer features in Opera Mini 5</a>, the second one does the <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-mobile-10-developers-introduction/">same for Opera Mobile 10</a>. And as you&#39;ve probably seen, Zi Bin has compiled a handy chart of <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2010/03/16/opera-standards-chart">standards supported in Opera Mobile 10, Mini 5 and Opera 10.5x for desktop</a>.</p>
<p>Let us know what you think!</p>
