<p>Want to start developing for web-enabled TVs, but worried that you&#39;ll need a roomful of big devices to test and debug your web applications? Fear not: with today&#39;s release of the <a href="http://www.opera.com/business/tv-emulator/">Opera TV Emulator</a> (formerly known as the Opera for Devices Content Development Kit), you can check how your pages will look and work on the latest Opera-based TV browsers...all from the comfort of your desktop machine.</p>

<p>Compared to the CDK versions (which only worked in Linux), the new Opera TV Emulator is available as a pre-packaged <a href="http://virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> image. This ensures a stable and consistent reference working environment, pre-configured to resemble those found on an actual device, and allows developers to easily test their sites under Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.</p>

<p>The main features of the new Opera TV Emulator:</p>

<ul>
<li>provides a reference <a href="http://directfb.org/">DirectFB</a> device environment</li>
<li>based on the latest Opera for Devices SDK 3.1</li>
<li>integrated web remote control accessible from the VirtualBox host environment</li>
<li>supports <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CE-HTML">CE-HTML</a> and HTML5 (including audio/video support and the inclusion of H.264 decoding capabilities)</li>
<li>improved integration with <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly">Opera Dragonfly</a>&#39;s remote debugging</li>
<li>ability to emulate different target device characteristics, such as allocated memory and browser speed, for a more accurate emulation of on-device performance</li>
</ul>
