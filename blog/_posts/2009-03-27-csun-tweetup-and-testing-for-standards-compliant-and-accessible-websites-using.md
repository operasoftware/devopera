<p>I was at <a href="http://www.csunconference.org/index.cfm?EID=80000144">CSUN</a> last week, the technology and persons with disabilities conference held in Los Angeles. It&#39;s one of my favorite conferences as you get a chance to talk with some of the great and the good of the web development world and talk about all things accessibility.</p>

<p>I had a fantastic few days kicked off by a <a href="http://www.csuntweetup.com">Tweetup</a> sponsored by the Opera Developer Network together with WebAim, The Paciello Group and Infoaxia. We had over 120 Twitterer&#39;s there who kept up the Twittering throughout the conference. You can catch up on what people were talking about by tracking <a href="http://www.tweetscan.com/index.php?s=%23csun09">#csun09</a>. We&#39;ll also be posting podcasts of lightning talks that people gave. My favorite was from Glenda Sims on the new WaSP <a href="http://interact.webstandards.org/">Interact education Framework</a>, a web standards curriculum for both educators and learners alike that the <a href="http://www.opera.com/wsc">Opera Web Standards Curriculum</a> is part of.</p>

<p>I was lucky enough to get a slot presenting on testing standards compliant and accessible websites using Opera. I really enjoyed the session which had a few of my favorite people attend such as Glenda Sims, Lisa Herrod, Jim Thatcher, Ralph Brandi, Jim Allan, Kazuhito Kidachi and Makoto Ukedi to name just a few.</p>

<p>Rather than just focus on testing tools we have in the browser I decided to also cover some of the non-testing related features Opera has that I find myself using daily to help me develop and test sites such as Sessions, Speed Dial, Notes and the Sidebar tools. I then looked at the <a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/2008/06/09/the-debug-menu-and-the-new-weekly">Debug menu</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/">Opera Dragonfly</a> and how you can use these to validate pages, test images, link text, scripts, plugins, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS and more.</abbr></p>

<p>You can get a copy of my slides below. They&#39;re written in HTML and can be viewed in any browser but are best viewed in Opera using Opera Show. They&#39;re written in such a way that they can be used as a stand alone tutorial so feel free to share them amongst friends or colleagues.</p>
