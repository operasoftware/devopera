Opera 22 (based on Chromium 35) for [Mac and Windows](http://www.opera.com/computer) and [for Android](http://www.opera.com/mobile/android) is out! Here’s what that means for web developers.

## CSS background blending modes

Support for [the `background-blend-mode` CSS property](http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/compositing-1/#background-blend-mode) is now enabled by default. This feature allows you to control how background images and background colors blend. Check out [a demo](http://codepen.io/bennettfeely/pen/rxoAc), or see [_Getting to know CSS Blend Modes_](http://dev.opera.com/articles/getting-to-know-css-blend-modes/#working-with-background-blend-mode) for more information.

## CSS Font Loading

The CSS Font Loading specification defines [a promise-based JavaScript API](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-font-loading/#font-face-load) to programmatically download web fonts. This makes it possible for web developers to take a different action based on whether or not the font was successfully loaded, or just to get notified when the font has completed loading. Here’s a simple example:

	var face = new FontFace('My Cool Font', 'url(http://example.com/my-cool-font.woff)', {
	  'weight': 'bold'
	});
	face.load().then(function() {
	  console.log('My Cool Font was successfully loaded!');
	}).catch(function() {
	  console.log('Something went wrong while trying to load My Cool Font.');
	});

## Unprefixed Shadow DOM

Opera previously supported the `webkitShadowRoot` property as well as the `webkitCreateShadowRoot` method for DOM elements. We now support [the standardized and unprefixed names for them](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/#extensions-to-element-interface), i.e. `shadowRoot` and `createShadowRoot`, as well as the newly added `getDestinationInsertionPoints` method. To learn more about Shadow DOM, [read this updated tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/).

## Unprefixed Web Audio API

Opera previously supported the global `webkitAudioContext` and `webkitOfflineAudioContext` methods. These have now been renamed to their official, unprefixed names: [`AudioContext`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-audiocontext-interface) and [`OfflineAudioContext`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-offlineaudiocontext-interface).

## More control over mousewheel-based scroll events

As of this release, web developers can now control or even cancel “zoom” events invoked by pressing `Ctrl` while scrolling the mousewheel. Sites that want to do something more appropriate for the user than trigger the browser’s native zoom, [can now do so](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/msg/blink-dev/BW4hshtMsmo/crQeQLoH7RYJ).

If you’re interested in experimenting with features that are in the pipeline for future versions of Opera, we recommend following [our Opera Developer stream](http://www.opera.com/developer).
