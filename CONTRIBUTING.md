# Contributing to Dev.Opera

We’re looking forward to your [Dev.Opera](http://dev.opera.com/) contributions!

- We pay a rate of $350 for a **2000 word article,** so ideally you should try to stick to that word count. Multiple part articles will be considered as well.
- We’re also happy to take in **code improvements** to the templates, styles and scripts powering Dev.Opera.

## Before you start

If you find a problem with the site, want to add a feature, submit an article, etc., check [already filed issues](https://github.com/operasoftware/devopera/issues) to see if no one else has filed a similar request or idea yet.

## Article suggestions & contributions

If you have an idea for an article, file an issue with an `article idea` label, where we can discuss further details. If you prefer email, that is fine as well: contact andreasbATopera.com.

We use pull requests for article submissions. If you’re not familiar with how this works, check out GitHub’s [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) guides.

The article creation process is best illustrated with a simple example. Let’s say you want to submit an article titled “My Fantastic Article”, which contains text and one image, called `my-special-image.jpg`. The current date is April 09 2014.

The article should be written in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, and is added under [devopera/articles/_posts/](https://github.com/operasoftware/devopera/tree/master/articles/_posts) as `2014-04-09-my-fantastic-article.md`.

Our image file then is placed in a folder called `my-fantastic-article` under [devopera/articles/](https://github.com/operasoftware/devopera/tree/master/articles). In the article, the image is referenced as `![My special image](/articles/article-slug/my-special-image.jpg)`.

There is no need to add YAML front matter (the bit of meta data on top of existing articles) when submitting an article. We’ll deal with this ourselves as part of the publishing process, and will get in touch if we have questions.

## Code improvements

If you want to file a bug report, or have an idea for an improvement to the site, [file an issue](https://github.com/operasoftware/devopera/issues/new) with the appropriate label, where we can discuss further details.

Just as for article submissions, we use pull requests for code improvements. If you’re not familiar with how this works, check out GitHub’s [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and [Using Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) guides.
