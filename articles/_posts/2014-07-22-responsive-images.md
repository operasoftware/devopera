## Introduction

Finally, true responsive images are becoming a reality on the web — in pure HTML, without convoluted hacks. The `<picture>` element and a couple of new attributes for the `<img>` element are behind a flag in Chromium 37 and shipping in Chromium 38 (so coming soon in Opera), in [Firefox Nightly](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=870022) and are being [implemented in WebKit](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134634) (although it remains to be seen if Apple will ship it in the next version of Safari).

The new `<picture>` element can be verbose and confusing, because it solves a range of use cases. To help you match your requirements to the responsive image syntax, we’ve prepared this article full of examples.

## Four questions

Before you start using responsive images in your design, you always have to answer the following four questions:

- Do I want my image **sizes** to change depending on my responsive design rules?
- Do I want to optimize for high-**dpi** screens?
- Do I want to serve images with different **mime** types to browsers that support them?
- Do I want to serve different **art** depending on certain contextual factors?

In the examples below, we’re referring to these questions with the keywords **sizes**, **dpi**, **mime** and **art**, respectively, and then for each combination of answers, we show a snippet of example code with a short explanation. When creating these examples, I had [this night shot of the Oslo Opera house](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Full_Opera_by_night.jpg) in my head — it might be useful for your reference.

<figure class="figure">
	<img src="{{ page.id }}/opera-house.jpg" alt="The Opera House in Oslo at night" class="figure__media">
	<figcaption class="figure__caption">The Opera House in Oslo at night</figcaption>
</figure>

## Things to keep in mind

Before you start looking at the different examples though, here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

- `<picture>` *requires* `<img>` as its last child. Without that, nothing is displayed. This is good for accessibility as there is just one traditional place for your alternate text, and it’s great for fallback content
in old browsers, which just show the `<img>` element.
- Think of `<picture>`, `sizes` and `srcset` attributes as overriding the `src` of the `<img>`. Check `currentSrc` in JavaScript to see what’s chosen by the browser. Old browsers will just use `<img src>` of course, so you’d use something like `image.currentSrc || image.src` to handle all cases.
- The `srcset` and `sizes` list is a hint to browsers, not a command. For example, a device with a device-pixel-ratio of 1.5 is free to use either the 1x or 2x image, depending on what it knows about its capabilities, the network, etc.
- `<img sizes="(max-width: 30em) 100vw …">` says: if this “media query”
is true, show the image with a `100vw` width. The first true “media query”
wins, so source order matters.

## Art direction use case

<span class="feature feature--false">sizes</span>
<span class="feature feature--false">dpi</span>
<span class="feature feature--false">mime</span>
<span class="feature feature--true">art</span>

	<picture>
		<source
			media="(min-width: 1024px)"
			srcset="opera-fullshot.jpg">
		<img
			src="opera-closeup.jpg" alt="The Oslo Opera House">
	</picture>

For browser windows with a width of 1024 CSS pixels and wider, a full-shot photo is used; smaller browser windows get a close-up photo.

## Different image types use case

<span class="feature feature--false">sizes</span>
<span class="feature feature--false">dpi</span>
<span class="feature feature--true">mime</span>
<span class="feature feature--false">art</span>

	<picture>
		<source
			srcset="opera.webp"
			type="image/webp">
		<img
			src="opera.jpg" alt="The Oslo Opera House">
	</picture>

Browsers that support WebP get a WebP image; other browsers get JPG.

For browser windows with a width of 1024 CSS pixels and wider, a full-shot photo is used; smaller browser windows get a close-up photo. This photo is served as WebP to browsers that support it; other browsers get JPG.

## High-DPI images use case

<span class="feature feature--false">sizes</span>
<span class="feature feature--true">dpi</span>
<span class="feature feature--false">mime</span>
<span class="feature feature--false">art</span>

	<img
		src="opera-1x.jpg" alt="The Oslo Opera House"
		srcset="opera-2x.jpg 2x, opera-3x.jpg 3x">

Browsers on devices with high-DPI screens get a high resolution image; other browsers get a normal image.

			src="opera-1x.jpg" alt="The Oslo Opera House"
			srcset="opera-2x.jpg 2x,
					opera-3x.jpg 3x">
	</picture>

Browsers on devices with high-DPI screens get an image with twice or even three times the amount of pixels; other browsers get a normal image. These photos are served as WebP to browsers that support it; other browsers get JPG.
