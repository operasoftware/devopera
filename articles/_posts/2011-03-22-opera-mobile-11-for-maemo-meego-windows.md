Today we are launching final versions of Opera Mobile 11 for Android and Symbian/S60 as well as Mini 6 for various platforms. We are also making available builds of Opera Mobile 11 for Maemo, MeeGo and Windows here on Opera Labs. The MeeGo and Windows builds come with our new tablet optimized UI.

Download on your device now from [m.opera.com][1], or use the following direct links to the [Windows][2], [MeeGo (generic)][3] and [MeeGo (WeTab)][4] versions.

On MeeGo, you may need to install the downloaded RPM package by running `rpm -i` as root in a terminal window. On the WeTab a reboot is required before the Opera icon becomes visible.

The recommended way to install on Maemo is to use the Application manager and enable the extras-testing repository.

Tap to zoom has been changed from single-click to double-click. You can now click links without having to zoom in first.
