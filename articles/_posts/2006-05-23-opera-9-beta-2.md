We released the second — and final — beta of Opera 9 today. This will be the last major milestone release before the final launch of Opera 9. The most notable change is to the widget UI. You’ll notice that we’ve included widgets separately in the menu bar. If you click to manage widgets, your widgets open in a separate tab, similar to our transfer manager. From this tab, you can add new widgets, open downloaded widgets and remove widgets you don’t want.
