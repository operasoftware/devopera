<p>Report written by Chris Mills and Patrick Lauke</p>

<p>On Wednesday 19th January 2011, we descended on Nottingham UK to
attend the first <a href="http://newadventuresconf.com/">New adventures
in web design</a> conference, the brainchild of Mr Simon Collison. It
looked to be a really interesting conference, with some interesting
sounding talks providing a bit of a break from the norm, and we had also
been given a table from which to distribute some merch and show off our
browsers!</p>

<p>After a &quot;few quiet beers&quot; on the wednesday night and an &quot;early
night&quot;, we met up at the conference venue, set up the display table, and
said hi to all the great people that started to wind their way in. The
talk highlights for us were as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dan Rubin: The new language of web design</strong>: Dan
opened proceedings with a very strong talk all about how language
affects us, and how we should use language more effectively to cause
less confusion and get messages across better, to clients and
users.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Mark Boulton: A new canon</strong>: Mark&#39;s talk was also
very strong, talking about some new design methods and best practices we
should adopt to drive the industry forward, and make working with the
web medium more effective. His three main points were &quot;content out not
canvas in&quot;, &quot;bind the content to the device&quot; (adopt responsive web
design techniques, abandon your precious control), and &quot;create
connectedness&quot; (eg don&#39;t use pixels, use ems, to make all the elements
of your design relate to one another).</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Jon Tan: Language and the lizard brain</strong>: Jon&#39;s
talk was also great - kind of an extension of Dan&#39;s earlier talk, but
with some interesting extensions. He cited some very interesting
information about &quot;the lizard brain&quot; - the Amygdala - which is all
lizards really have, but is only a small part of the human brain. It is
the part of the brain that deals with emotional responses, and is
therefore heavily involved in our response to design, before we even
read any language involved in the design. He went through some
interesting ideas on emotional design, but my favourite point was when
he fought back against Seth Godin&#39;s constant advice about surpressing
the lizard brain, because it gets in the way of efficiency and
organization. Jon pointed out that emotional responses are important to
really appreciate design work.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Andy Clarke: Once upon a time on the Web</strong>: Andy
gleefully told us that private dicks were &quot;so last year&quot;, announcing
that he was moving on to cowboys for 2011. His talk was all about story
telling, not only in terms of well written stories, but also in terms of
using space and separation effectively for the visual part of the
narrative. Both exist in the story that an effective web application
tells, and he did well to compare web pages to comic books to hammer the
point home. Fun and interesting.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Brendan Dawes: Produced for use</strong>: Brendan&#39;s talk
was basically about product design, and why products are useful, usable
and sellable, or not. He looked at a whole load of physical products
like Pencils, paperclips, pencil sharpeners (and his obsession for
stationary), before then drawing it back to the Web, with interesting
UIs, and interfaces for products that bridge the gap between virtual and
physical. I&#39;m not sure how immediately practical it was, but Brendan&#39;s
delivery is always so charming and humourous that you can&#39;t help but
walk away smiling. A great way to end the day!</p></li>

</ul>

<p>At the end of the conference, the <a href="http://inspireconf.com/">Ready to Inspire conference</a> was
announced, which also looks well worth checking out. the rest of the
evening was very enjoyable, talking to developers and designers about
music and open standards until the small hours.</p>
