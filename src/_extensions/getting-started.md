## Learn the essentials

To get a good overview of how things work, we would suggest to start with an [overview of the Opera extensions architecture](/extensions/architecture-overview/).

To learn how to make Opera extensions, read our [making your first Opera extension](/extensions/basics/) article: this will get you familiar with the basics of making a simple extension.

With the basics behind you, consult our range of tutorials and walk-throughs for much more detailed information on specific aspects of extension development and API usage.

## Test, debug and look things over

Identify issues and solve them easily by reading our [guide to testing and debugging Opera extensions](/extensions/testing/).

## Finally, show it to the world!

You can share your extensions with the world by submitting them to the Opera add-ons gallery. To make this process easier and smoother, read the [guidelines on submitting extensions](/extensions/publishing-guidelines/) to the add-ons store. We’ve also provided a [handy checklist of the acceptance criteria for you to follow](/extensions/publishing-guidelines/#acceptance-criteria), to speed up the submission process further.

Take a look at our [branding guidelines](/extensions/branding-guidelines/) for the official opera add-ons catalog button that you can use on your site to indicate that your extension is available. Pair with with [inline installation](/extensions/inline-installation/) of extension to offer a smooth extension install experience to your users with them leaving your website.
