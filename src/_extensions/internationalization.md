## Introduction

In this tutorial, we’ll see how internationalization, or _i18n_ in short, can be achieved in opera extensions.

## The basic principles

You can support multiple locales in Opera extensions. The first thing to do is to create a directory called `_locales`. Under this directory you create a subdirectory for each locale you need. For example, if you want your extensions to support American English, British English as well as Spanish, you will create `_locales/en_US`, `_locales/en_GB` and `_locales/es`.

In each of each of these subdirectories, you will need to create a file called `messages.json`, which will store the list of translated text strings needed.

Above you can see how the file structure of an opera extension with i18n support will look like.

The way in which the browser will search and apply a translation is based on the following steps:

1. **Search for the exact dialect:** If the user’s system locale is set to a dialect of a language (Like “American English” — which is `en_US`) then it will see whether the translation of that message exists in the `messages.json` file in the `en_US` folder. If no such message exists, or the file or folder does not exist itself, then it will go to the next step.
2. **Search for the language:** If the message translation in the exact dialect cannot be found (In our case, `en_US`), then it will try to look for a `messages.json` file in the `en` folder, if it exists. If it manages to find a translation in the `messages.json` file in the `en` folder, it will use it. However, if it cannot find it (whether its because there is no such translation in `message.json`, or if the file or folder does not exist), it will go to the next step.
3. **Use the default locale:** If the translation in neither the dialect nor the general language can be found (for example, the translation cannot be found in either `_locales/en_US/messages.json` nor `_locales/en/messages.json`), then it will use the translation as provided in default locale (for example, if the default locale is set to `es`, then it would end up using the message in `_locales/es/messages.json`).

## Translating Text: Manifest and CSS Files

You will need a translated version of the text in many different parts of the extension: the manifest file, the CSS files, and various JavaScript files. When it comes to the manifest and CSS files, you can access various strings using the `__MSG_<messagename>__` convention.

Let’s take an example. A normal manifest file (which is not internationalized) would look like the following:

	{
		"name": "Hello World!",
		"description": "This is a sample description."
	}

If we were to create add Spanish language support to it, then we would create a directory as `_locales/es` and have a file called `messages.json` in it, where we would list the translated text in the following way:

	{
		"extensionName": {
			"message": "Hola Mundo!"
		},
		"extensionDescription":{
			"message": "Esta es una extensión de la muestra."
		}
	}

Now, we are going to change the `manifest.json` file to add i18n support. It will now look like so:

	{
		"name": "__MSG_extensionName__",
		"description": "__MSG_extensionDescription__",
		"default_locale": "en_US",
	}

Here, `__MSG_extensionName__` will refer to the `extensionName` field. If the user’s locale is set to Spanish, then it will display the Spanish text.

	<img elem="media" src="{{ page.id }}/spanish.png" alt="Spanish internationalization example">
</figure>

When writing CSS for your extensions, you can refer to various translated strings in the same way using the `__MSG_<messagename>__` convention.

### Predefined Messages

You also have access to some predefined messages which are helpful when writing CSS or JavaScript code. All predefined messages have a `@@` at the beginning. An example of this is the `@@extension_id` keyword which gives the ID of the extension. Below is a list of all the predefined messages you have access to.

- `@@extension_id`: Gives the ID of the extension.
- `@@ui_locale`: The current locale of the browser.
- `@@bidi_dir`: The direction of the text flow of the current locale. For languages such as English, Spanish, Hindi etc it would be `ltr` (left to right) and for languages such as Japanese or Arabic it would be `rtl` (right to left).
- `@@bidi_reversed_dir`: This is the opposite of `@@bidi_dir`. If the value of `@@bidi_dir` is `ltr` then the value of `@@bidi_reversed_dir` will be `rtl`, otherwise it would be `ltr`.
- `@@bidi_start_edge`: If the value of `@@bidi_dir` is `ltr`, then this value will be `left`. If the value of `@@bidi_dir` is `rtl`, then it is `right`.
- `@@bidi_end_edge`: If the value of `@@bidi_dir` is `ltr`, then this value will be `right`. If the value of `@@bidi_dir` is `rtl`, then it is `left`.

Predefined messages are particularly helpful in CSS. For example, we can write the following in our CSS file:

	body {
		direction: __MSG_@@bidi_dir__;
	}
	header {
		float: __MSG_@@bidi_start_edge__;
		padding-__MSG_@@bidi_end_edge: 25px;
	}

If the current locale is a `ltr` language like English, then the CSS will effectively be:

	body {
		direction: ltr;
	}
	header {
		float: left;
		padding-right: 25px;
	}

In case the current locale is a `rtl` language like Arabic, then the CSS will effectively be:

	body {
		direction: rtl;
	}
	header {
		float: right;
		padding-left: 25px;
	}

## The i18n API

To help you in internationalization, please take a look at the `chrome.i18n.*` methods — in particular, the function `getMessage()`.

One of the most common use cases for this API would be to translate the text in the html files (like the popup files, the options files etc). An interesting way to do this is to mark up the text you want translated using a `data-*` attribute.

For example, let’s say we have an extension which has a popup. This popup has some text in it, which we would like to be translated in other languages too. We will have the text in the messages.json files like so:

The `messages.json` file in the `_locales/en_GB` folder

	{
		"extTitle": {
			"message": "Sample i18n Extension"
		},
		"extDesc": {
			"message": "You are using the British English locale `en_GB`."
		}
	}

The `messages.json` file in the `_locales/en_US` folder

	{
		"extTitle": {
			"message": "Sample i18n Extension",
			"description": "Title of the extension"
		},
		"extDesc":{
			"message": "You are using the American English locale `en_US`."
		}
	}

The `messages.json` file in the `_locales/es` folder

	{
		"extTitle":{
			"message": "Extensión i18n Muestra",
		},
		"extDesc":{
			"message": "Está utilizando española locale `es`."
		}
	}

In our popup file, we would like the heading to be the title of the extension (which in our case is `extTitle`), and some text beneath (`extDesc`). We’ll markup the popup.html file like so:

	<h1 data-translate="extTitle">
		Sample i18n Extension
	</h1>
	<p data-translate="extDesc">
		This is a sample extension to help you with i18n.
	</p>

Here you can see that we have used a `data-*` attribute which we have named as `data-translate`. In our JavaScript code, we will loop over all elements, and detect if the element has a `data-translate` attribute associated with it. If so, we will take the value of it and find the corresponding message in the `messages.json` file using the function `getMessage()`. Let us see an example of it.

	var elements = document.querySelectorAll('[data-translate]');
	[].forEach.call(elements, function(element) {
		element.textContent = chrome.i18n.getMessage(element.dataset.translate);
	});

This will ensure that when the locale is set to English, then the text in the popup will display in English, like so:

<figure block="figure">
	<img elem="media" src="{{ page.id }}/popup-en.png" alt="Popup in English">
</figure>

But when the locale is set to Spanish, then it will display Spanish text like so:

<figure block="figure">
	<img elem="media" src="{{ page.id }}/popup-es.png" alt="Popup in Spanish">
</figure>
