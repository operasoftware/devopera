## Introduction

The Opera Extension APIs provide a lot of power when it comes to manipulating windows and tabs inside the browser. In this article, you’ll take a deeper look at how to manipulate windows and tabs in extensions.

## Tabs

The ability to manipulate tabs is one of the most basic but powerful and useful features of extensions. The [Tabs and Windows API guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs) provides a detailed overview of the methods and events associated with it.

To work with tabs in an extension you need to first specify the relevant permissions in the `permissions` field of the extension manifest, like so:

	{
		"permissions": ["tabs"]
	}

### Creating a new tab

Creating a new tab is done using the `create()` method. Inside this method you can specify the properties of the tab you want to create (for example the URL, whether it should be an active tab, whether it should be a pinned tab or not, etc.)

For example, to specify extension functionality that opens up a new pinned tab containing [opera.com](https://www.opera.com) when a button is clicked, you need to add this to the _background.js_ file:

	chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
		chrome.tabs.create({
			'url': 'https://www.opera.com'
		});
	});

You can [download the sample extension](/extensions/extension-samples/win-tabs-create-tab.nex) and take a better look at how this works.

### Accessing the current tab

You can access the currently active tab and its properties via the `query()` method, for example:

	chrome.tabs.query({
		currentWindow: true,
		active: true
	});

Let’s extend this example a bit. To specify that on the click of a button the browser will take the current URL and open a new tab where it will run the URL through the WAVE accessibility evaluation tool, you could do something like this:

	chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
		chrome.tabs.query({
			currentWindow: true,
			active: true
		}, function(tab) {
			chrome.tabs.create({
				'url': 'http://wave.webaim.org/report?url=' + tab[0].url
			});
		});
	});

You can [download the WAVE extension](/extensions/extension-samples/win-tabs-wave.nex) and play with this code further.

### Modifying existing tabs

You can modify existing tabs using the `update()` method, performing tasks such as changing the URL loaded, making tabs active, highlighting, or pinning them. The `query()` method explained above is used to select the tab(s) you want to affect.

For example, imagine you wanted to create an extension that allows us to redirect all tabs on [Dev.Opera](http://dev.opera.com) (not just the front page, but various articles too) to the [Opera homepage](https://www.opera.com).

In the _background.js_, you would write something like:

	var pattern = 'http://dev.opera.com/*';

This pattern will match all tabs that point to URLs on `dev.opera.com` including subdomains if any.

	chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
		chrome.tabs.query({
			'currentWindow': true,
			'url': pattern
		// This will match all tabs to the pattern we specified
		}, function(tab) {
			// Go through all tabs that match the URL pattern
			for (var i = 0; i < tab.length; i++){
				// Update those tabs to point to the new URL,
				// which is the Opera homepage
				chrome.tabs.update(
					tab[i].id, {
						'url': 'https://www.opera.com'
					}
				);
			}
		});
	});

You can [download the update example extension](/extensions/extension-samples/win-tabs-update-tab.nex) to see the above code in action.

### Closing, reloading and duplicating tabs

To close, reload and duplicate tabs, you need to use the `remove()`, `reload()` and `duplicate()` methods respectively. The important thing to note about these methods is that you do not necessarily need to mention the `tabs` permission in the extension manifest in order to use them in the extension.

All three of these methods work in the same way. Let’s look at some example extension code that reloads a tab. The first thing to do would be to get hold of the current tab, after which you would call the `reload()` method. So, in the background script you would write something like so:

	chrome.tabs.query({
		currentWindow: true,
		active: true
	// Get the current tab
	}, function(tab){
		// Remove the tab
		chrome.tabs.remove(tab[0].id);
	});

You can use the `remove()` and `duplicate()` methods in exactly the same way. Take a look at our [sample close, reload and duplicate extension example](/extensions/extension-samples/win-tabs-close-reload-duplicate.nex) where we make use of all three methods to close, reload and duplicate the current tab.

There are more functions available in Opera extensions: to find out about them, consult the [API guide for Tabs and Windows](/extensions/tab-window/).

## Windows

Windows are easy to create using the Tabs and Windows APIs. The first thing to do when working with windows is to specify the necessary permissions in the extension manifest:

	{
		"permissions": ["tabs"]
	}

**Note:** Yes, we specified `tabs` in the above manifest code: this is _deliberate_. Windows and tabs are so closely related that it is a good idea to mention `tabs` in the extension manifest whenever you are working with windows.

The most common use case for the Windows API is to create a new window. Usually, when you create a new window, you’ll want to open a bunch of tabs and URLs inside it. Let’s create an extension that does exactly that.

The most common and hence most important function to note, when it comes to windows, is the `create()` function. It simply allows us to create a new window, specifying exactly what type of window we want. In this case, the code will create a new private window, with a few links already opened in it.

You can achieve this by writing the following in the _background.js_:

	var url_list = [
		'https://www.opera.com',
		'http://www.wikipedia.org',
		'http://www.google.com'
	];

The list of URLs to load in the new window.

	chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
		chrome.windows.create({
			'url': url_list,
			'incognito': true
		});
	});

[Download the sample window extension](/extensions/extension-samples/win-tabs-private-window.nex) to see the above functionality in action and play with the code yourself.
