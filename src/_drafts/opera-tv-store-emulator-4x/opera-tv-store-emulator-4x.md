## About the Opera TV Emulator 4.x

The Opera TV Store Emulator allows web developers to check how their HTML5-based applications look and behave in the [Opera TV Store][1].

The Opera TV Store Emulator is created as an extension for the Opera 24+ Desktop browser.

For SDK 3.x emulation, please use the older [Opera TV Emulator 3.4][2].

## Features {#features}

- Default CSS TV colors
- Remote control widget is enabled all the time and is located on the bottom of the screen. It is possible to hide it, when clicking the dash icon.
- Functional key mappings — VK_KEY button emulation, including directional, enter, back and color buttons (r,g,b,y)
- Draggable popup with information appears when the `window.close` function is called

## Navigation {#navigation}

For keyboard navigation, refer to the mapping below:

- ←↑→↓ cursor keys move the focus
- the backspace key maps to the Return/Back key
- the enter key activates the currently focused element

In addition to basic keyboard controls, the Opera TV Emulator also provides a more comprehensive remote control widget that simulates the colored keys (red, green, yellow, blue) and a set of media controls (play/pause, stop, rewind, fast-forward).

## Notes {#notes}

- SDK 4.x and Opera desktop are both Blink based.
- In order to simulate Spatial Navigation, run the Opera browser from the command line using the "enable-spatial-navigation" argument.
- H.264 support is available from Opera 25 onward.
- For information about the specific multimedia formats that can be used, please refer to the article on [HTML5 audio/video support in Opera TV Store applications][4].
- The Chromium version installed on actual devices is 35, while the Chromium version in your Opera browser is likely higher. Because of that some incompatibilities may occur. We recommend to also always test on an actual device with the Opera TV Store included.
