<p>I was privileged to be invited to speak on <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 at <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/2009/london/schedule">Future of Web Apps London last week</a>. My talk was called <a href="http://people.opera.com/brucel/talks/2009/Bruce-Lawson-Opera-FOWA-HTML5.pdf"><abbr>HTML</abbr>5: The Future of Web Applications (<abbr>PDF</abbr> 636K)</a>. It&#39;s a newly written talk that concentrates on the apps side of the language, rather than the markup side that I usually show. That seemed appropriate given the apps-focus of the show, and the <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0215.html"><abbr>HTML</abbr>5 editor&#39;s assertion</a> that <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 is</p>
<blockquote cite="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2009Jan/0215.html">extending the language to better support Web applications, since that is one of the directions the Web is going in and is one of the areas least well served by HTML so far.
This puts HTML in direct competition with other technologies intended for applications deployed over the Web, in particular Flash and Silverlight.</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://vimeo.com/6985053">video is now available</a>, as is a <a href="http://joeloverton.com/html5/">transcript</a>.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, I was woken by the organisers asking me to do a second talk. As I had no time to prepare, I coded an <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 page live. Five minutes before going on stage, my laptop died; thanks so much to the guys on the Microsoft stand who lent me a replacement Windows machine, installed the necessary software and got my lappie running again!</p>

<p>Consequently there are no slides to publish, but I have an article called <a href="http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/">Designing a blog with <abbr>HTML</abbr></a> that covers the same ground. (Two articles on this blog cover it in much more detail: <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/redesigning-with-html-5-wai-aria/">Redesigning with HTML 5 and WAI-ARIA</a> and <a href="http://www.brucelawson.co.uk/2009/marking-up-a-blog-with-html-5-part-2/">Marking up a blog with HTML 5 (part 2)</a>.)</p>

Some other useful resources:

<li><a href="http://gsnedders.html5.org/outliner/"><abbr>HTML</abbr>5 outliner</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.html5doctor.com/"><abbr>HTML</abbr>5 Doctor</a> (I&#39;m a co-curator of this site)</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also <a href="https://www.opera.com/">download Opera 10</a> which I was using to demo.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://cnettv.cnet.com/news-future-web-apps-london/9742-1_53-50077840.html">snippet of an interview with me about <abbr>HTML</abbr>5 and mobile by Natali del Conte</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, thanks to all those who came along and gave me great feedback. I was literally hoarse from chatting in the breaks, in the pub and everywhere else about <abbr>HTML</abbr>5. The biggest gripe (apart from those appalled by the fact that <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html-5-xml-xhtml-5/">you can use <abbr>XML</abbr> syntax or not, as you wish</a>) was the stylability of the new form elements and their error messages. I&#39;d love to hear your feedback on this.</p>
