[Opera 20 for Mac and Windows](https://www.opera.com/computer) (based on Chromium 33) is out! Here’s what that means for web developers.

## Background (parallel) JavaScript compilation/optimization

Until now, the V8 JavaScript engine took turns compiling optimized JavaScript code and executing it. For large pieces of code this could become a nuisance, and in complex applications like games it could even lead to stuttering and dropped frames. Recently, [the V8 team enabled concurrent compilation](http://blog.chromium.org/2014/02/compiling-in-background-for-smoother.html), which tackles this issue. As a result, JavaScript-heavy web pages run smoother in Opera 20.

## Custom Elements

Opera 20 supports the Web Components / Custom Elements spec by default. This means you can use [`document.registerElement()`](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/#extensions-to-document-interface-to-register) to register custom elements, and `document.createElement(elementName, typeExtension)` to instantiate type extension-style custom elements. See [this Custom Elements tutorial](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/) for more information.

## Unprefixed Page Visibility API

You can now use  `document.hidden` instead of `document.webkitHidden` and listen for `visibilitychange` event rather than the `webkitvisibilitychange` event.

## More extension APIs

Opera 20 for Desktop adds the following APIs to extensions:

* [`chrome.system.storage`](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/system.storage.html)
* [`chrome.downloads`](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/downloads.html)
* [`chrome.proxy`](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/proxy.html)

See [our Opera 15+ extensions documentation](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/) for in-depth discussion of these APIs.

If you’re interested in experimenting with features that are in the pipeline for future versions of Opera, we recommend following [our Opera Developer stream](https://www.opera.com/developer).
