Opera 43 (based on Chromium 56) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## Prerender from address bar

Opera will now prerender pages that are typed into the address bar, before the user hits enter,
which can make the page finish loading much sooner.

If you can predict what the user's likely next navigation will be, you can start a prerender from
the current page by using [`<link rel=prerender>`](https://w3c.github.io/resource-hints/#dfn-prerender).
This has actually been supported since Opera 15, but this seemed like a good opportunity for a
reminder. 🙂 For more information about how to use `prerender` and other resource hints, see
[Resource Hints – What is Preload, Prefetch, and Preconnect?](https://www.keycdn.com/blog/resource-hints/)
by Brian Jackson.

## Classic link selection

Opera now allows users to select link text instead of always dragging the link (like Presto-based Opera).
The user can select by dragging left or right, and start a drag-and-drop by dragging up or down.

Not being able to select text to copy and paste is often frustrating for users. But in some cases it
can be justified, like if a link is being used to act as a button, or if text is used only for
decoration. To disable text selection in general, CSS [`user-select: none`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select)
can be used.

## Scroll anchoring intervention

When some content changes above the viewport (e.g., an image is loaded), what used to happen is that
the rest of the content is pushed down. With the [scroll anchoring](https://github.com/WICG/ScrollAnchoring/blob/master/explainer.md)
intervention the scroll position is updated to keep the content currently in the viewport stable.
This behavior can be disabled for a specific subtree or for the whole page by using CSS `overflow-anchor: none`.
See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fejv0cM7Jig) for a comparison with and without this
intervention.

## CSS

* Opera now supports [`position: sticky`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#Sticky_positioning),
a new way to position elements. A `position: sticky` element is relatively-positioned, but becomes
`position: fixed` after the user reaches a certain scroll position. This results in smoother scroll
without jumps compared to trying to achieve the same thing with `scroll` events and JavaScript.
For more info see [this article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/position-sticky)
by Paul Kinlan.
* The [new generic font family](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#extended-generics) `system-ui`
is now supported, which matches the platform's default UI font.
* [`touch-action: pinch-zoom`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/touch-action) is now supported.
* Non-whitespace Unicode control characters will now be rendered according to the
[specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text/#white-space-processing), rather than being ignored.

## HTTP `Referrer-Policy` header

The new [`Referrer-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
HTTP header allows sites to forward site traffic by URL without leaking the user’s session identifier
or other private information.

## Events: `keyboardEvent.isComposing`

The [`KeyboardEvent`](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#idl-keyboardevent) interface now supports the
[`isComposing`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/isComposing) attribute
which returns `true` if this event is fired between `compositionstart` and `compositionend` events.

## Canvas

[`ImageBitmapRenderingContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmapRenderingContext)
can be used to reduce memory consumption and compositing overhead by rendering pixel data in the form
of an [`ImageBitmap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ImageBitmap).

## Audio/video

* [`ConstantSourceNode`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#ConstantSourceNode) is a new audio source node that produces a constant output mixed with an `AudioParam`.
* Two Web Audio [`ChannelSplitterNode`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-channelsplitternode-interface) interface attributes are now read-only: `channelCount`, which is defined by `numberOfOutputs` in `createChannelSplitter()`, and `channelCountMode`, which is set to explicit.
* [`PannerNode.rolloffFactor`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-PannerNode-rolloffFactor) now clamps to the nominal range of a PannerNode’s distance model to describe the volume reduction rate as the source moves away from the listener.
* Support for [FLAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAC) is enabled within the FLAC and [Ogg](https://xiph.org/flac/ogg_mapping.html) containers for the `audio` HTML element and [`decodeAudioData()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/decodeAudioData).
* [OPUS](http://opus-codec.org/) can now be used with [`decodeAudioData()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioContext/decodeAudioData), expanding the variety of audio codecs supported by the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

## Shadow DOM

* Shadow DOM’s [`slotchange`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#signaling-slot-change) events bubble, but no longer re-fires, at a `slot`'s `assignedSlot`.

## Deprecated and removed features

* Non-script MIME types for external scripts (e.g., `<script src="foo" type="something/something">`) was deprecated (generated a message in the console) in Opera 42 and now in Opera 43 are no longer pre-fetched. This typically results in less wasted fetches. `<script data-src="foo" type="something/something">` is recommended instead.
* The Web Audio API no longer includes the deprecated Doppler API, including `speedOfSound`, `dopplerFactor`, and `setVelocity`.
* [`RTCPeerConnection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/RTCPeerConnection#RTCConfiguration_dictionary) now accepts `iceTransportPolicy` as an `RTCConfiguration` parameter as well as `iceTransports`.
* [`RTCPeerConnection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection) is now available without a webkit prefix, though `webkitRTCPeerConnection` still remains.
* The `reflected-xss` directive has been removed from [Content Security Policy 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) since it was solely a wrapper for the `X-XSS-Protection` header and provided no additional functionality.
* Support for the `MediaStreamTrack.getSources()` method has been removed in favor of `MediaDevices.enumerateDevices()`.
* The CSP `referrer` directive is no longer supported in favor of the new `Referrer-Policy` header mentioned above.
* Legacy CBC-mode [ECDSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm) cipher suites ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA have been removed in favor of modern ciphers such as ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256.
* ECDSA with both SHA-1 and SHA-512 have been removed to reduce dependencies on SHA-1 and align with TLS 1.3's new ECDSA handling.
* `MIDIMessageEvent.receivedTime` has been deprecated in favor of `Event.timeStamp`, since `Event.timeStamp` now supports high-resolution monotonic time instead of epoch time.
