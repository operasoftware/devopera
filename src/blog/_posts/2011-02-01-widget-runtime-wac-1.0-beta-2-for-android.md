Hi guys,

Today we are rolling out the next bugfix release of our Android widget runtime with WAC 1.0 APIs support. Many bugs were fixed since the previous release.

Download the [Android build][1].

Another focus feature of this release is Android’s home screen integration — now widgets can be added to the home screen. This is our initial version of integration, which we plan to expand further in the future.

Please refer to the [previous release’s][2] post for details about building WAC applications, dev articles and more. We are always interested in your feedback; please share your thoughts about this release here: [Opera Widgets Forum][3].
