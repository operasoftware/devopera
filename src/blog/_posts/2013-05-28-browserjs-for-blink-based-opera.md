Some may have noticed that the Browser.js status page shows that it is indeed active in Opera 14 on Android and in the new Opera Next 15 for desktop.

Just today [we put the initial files on GitHub](https://github.com/operasoftware/browserjs). There isn’t much in them yet and we hope it will not be necessary to add much to them either, certainly less than we’ve had in Opera Classic ;-)

In Opera 12 and earlier Browser.js was quite powerful, being able to use all the UserJS events in Presto. So far these have not been carried over to Opera 14+ (all developers have been busy writing new UI etc.), meaning Browser.js in Opera 14+ is less versatile than we’re used to. Time will tell what will be needed to support.
