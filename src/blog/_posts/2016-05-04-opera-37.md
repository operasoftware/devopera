Opera 37 (based on Chromium 50) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## ES6: `RegExp` Unicode flag

ES6 specifies the `u` flag which enables more Unicode-friendly features and behavior in regular expressions. For example, it allows using astral symbols in character class ranges:

	// Match any symbol from U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO to U+1F4AB DIZZY SYMBOL.
	const regex = /[💩-💫]/u; // Or, `/[\u{1F4A9}-\u{1F4AB}]/u`.
	console.log(
		regex.test('💨'), // false
		regex.test('💩'), // true
		regex.test('💪'), // true
		regex.test('💫'), // true
		regex.test('💬')  // false
	);

For more information on the effects of the `u` flag, see [“Unicode-aware regular expressions in ECMAScript 6”](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex).

## ES6: more well-known symbols

Five more [ECMAScript well-known symbols](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-well-known-symbols) have been implemented:

* [`Function.prototype[Symbol.hasInstance]`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-function.prototype-@@hasinstance), used in [the `instanceof` operator](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-instanceofoperator).
* [`RegExp.prototype[Symbol.match]`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-regexp.prototype-@@match), used to [brand an object as `RegExp`-like](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-isregexp), and used in [`String.prototype.match`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-string.prototype.match);
* [`RegExp.prototype[Symbol.replace]`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-regexp.prototype-@@replace), used in [`String.prototype.replace`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-string.prototype.replace);
* [`RegExp.prototype[Symbol.search]`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-regexp.prototype-@@search), used in [`String.prototype.search`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-string.prototype.search);
* [`RegExp.prototype[Symbol.split]`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-regexp.prototype-@@split), used in [`String.prototype.split`](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-string.prototype.split).

These last four symbols act as hooks for `RegExp` subclasses to change the semantics of matching. By overriding `MyRegExpSubclass.prototype[Symbol.match]` etc. developers can change how the subclass behaves with respect to `String.prototype.match` and similar methods.

## Bold emoji on OS X

Previously, emoji with `font-weight: bold` applied to them failed to render in Chromium on OS X. This is now fixed. **🙌🎉**

## `<link rel="preload" as="…">`

[The `preload` link relation](https://w3c.github.io/preload/#link-type-preload) makes it possible to define custom loading logic without suffering the performance penalty that script-based resource loaders incur. It can be combined with the `as` attribute to signal to the browser [what kind of resource](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-destination) is being preloaded. This enables various optimizations that `<link rel="prefetch">` or `preload`’s predecessor `<link rel="subresource">` don’t offer. See [Yoav Weiss’ excellent article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/preload-what-is-it-good-for/) for more information.

## CSS `column-fill`

When using multi-column layouts, [the CSS `column-fill` property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-1/#cf) indicates whether columns should be balanced or not. If they are balanced, each column gets similar amounts of content inside. If they are not balanced, each column is filled to the height of the multicol container, until all the content is displayed. [The spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-multicol-1/#cf) contains some examples with visualizations.

## Canvas updates

`<canvas>` element instances now support [the `toBlob()` method](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#dom-canvas-toblob) alongside the `toDataURL()` method. `toBlob()` is typically more efficient than `toDataURL`, as it enables you to work with the encoded binary data directly rather than with a Base64-encoded string.

The global [`createImageBitmap()`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#dom-createimagebitmap) method decodes an image in the background and returns an [`ImageBitmap`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#the-imagebitmap-rendering-context) which you can draw onto a `<canvas>` in the same way you would an `<img>` element, another canvas, or a video. See [Paul Lewis’ write-up](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/createimagebitmap-in-chrome-50) for more details.

## `DOMTokenList` validation

It’s now possible to programmatically detect support of values for HTML attributes that are backed by `DOMTokenList` instances in JavaScript. Currently, those HTML attributes are the following:

* [`<link rel>` relations](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#attr-link-rel)
* [`<iframe sandbox>` directives](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#attr-iframe-sandbox)

To test a value, just use [`.supports(value)`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-domtokenlist-supports) on the `DOMTokenList` instance. For more information, check out [the Google Developers blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/domtokenlist-validation-added-in-chrome-50).

## `FormData` updates

[The `FormData` interface](https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-formdata) provides a way to easily construct a set of key/value pairs representing form fields and their values, which can then be easily sent using `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch`. Previously, `FormData` objects had a single `append()` method, and were thus write-only. The spec has now added `has()`, `get()`, `getAll()`, `delete()`, `set()`, `entries()`, `keys()`, `values()`, `forEach()` and `Symbol.iterator()` methods to allow inspection, iteration, and modification. [Check out the demo.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/formdata-methods/)

## `HTMLMediaElement.prototype.play()` returns a promise

[The `play` method](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#dom-media-play) on `<video>` or `<audio>` element instances now returns a promise. If playback succeeds, the promise is fulfilled, and if playback fails, the promise is rejected along with an error message explaining the failure. For more details, check out [Jeff Posnick’s blog post](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/play-returns-promise) or [view the demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/play-return-promise/).

## Presentation API updates

Support for the `statechange` event on `PresentationConnection` instances has been removed since it’s no longer part of [the spec](https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/#event-handlers-1). On the other hand, the `message`, `connect`, `close`, and `terminate` event are now implemented.

## Web Animations API updates

This release introduces the following Web Animations API changes to improve interoperability with other browsers and to improve spec compliance:

* [`Animation.prototype.id`](https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/#the-animation-interface)
* `cancel` events
* Deprecation of dashed names as keys in keyframes (to be removed in the next release)
* State change for the `pause()` method

For details, see [Alex Danilo’s write-up about these features](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/web-animations-improvements).

## Web Audio API updates

Automations for the [`BiquadFilter`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-biquadfilternode-interface) node now run at a-rate (updated every frame) instead of at k-rate (updated every rendering quantum of 128 frames). This change matches the spec.

## Sequential focus navigation starting point

The [sequential focus navigation starting point](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#sequential-focus-navigation-starting-point) is how the HTML spec defines where browsers should start to search for focusable areas when pressing Tab or Shift+Tab while there is no focused area. This is now implemented according to the spec.

## X25519 for TLS

Chromium 50 brings support for X25519, the Diffie-Hellman primitive over [Curve25519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-curve25519-01), to TLS. When compared to P-256, the most commonly used curve in TLS today, it admits simpler, faster implementations that are more naturally resistant to side-channels. Servers may [negotiate](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/#rfc.section.6.3.2.2) X25519 for ECDH instead of existing curves.

## Deprecated or removed features

The Geolocation API [no longer works on insecure origins](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/04/geolocation-on-secure-contexts-only). Use HTTPS instead.

The use of [the application cache API](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#applicationcache) on insecure origins has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use HTTPS and service workers instead.

Support for [the insecure TLS fallback mechanism](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=583787) has been removed. This does *not* remove support for older versions of TLS — it just prevents attackers from downgrading the connection to use outdated, insecure ciphers. If your server is affected by this change, it does not implement TLS correctly. Consider upgrading to TLS 1.2 — all ciphers in prior versions have known problems.

[The SVG `zoom` event](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/single-page.html#script-InterfaceSVGZoomEvent) was never fully implemented in Chromium, causing false positives in feature detection scripts. It has now been deprecated and its removal is planned for Chromium 52 / Opera 39.

Support for the non-standard `-webkit-background-composite` CSS property has been removed.

The WebRTC `RTCPeerConnection` instance methods [`createOffer()`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#widl-RTCPeerConnection-createOffer-Promise-RTCSessionDescription--RTCOfferOptions-options) and [`createAnswer()`](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#widl-RTCPeerConnection-createAnswer-void-RTCSessionDescriptionCallback-successCallback-RTCPeerConnectionErrorCallback-failureCallback) now require an error handler as well as a success handler. Previously it was possible to call these methods with only a success handler. This non-standard behavior has been deprecated.

Support for `<link rel="subresource">` has been removed. It never worked as intended, and no other browser engines implemented it. Use the `preconnect`, `prefetch`, `preload`, or `prerender` link relations instead, or use a service worker in combination with the Cache API for more fine-grained control.

The non-standard `KeyboardEvent.prototype.keyLocation` alias has been removed. To disambiguate between keys that are on multiple places on a keyboard, like numbers and Enter, use [`KeyboardEvent.prototype.location`](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#events-keyboard-key-location) instead.

Support for [`document.defaultCharset`](https://github.com/whatwg/dom/issues/58#issuecomment-162481999) has been removed.

`Object.observe()` has been [removed](https://esdiscuss.org/topic/an-update-on-object-observe) from the ECMAScript spec and is now no longer supported in Chromium. Use the `Proxy` API to observe objects instead.

The `SVGElement` instance properties `offsetParent`, `offsetTop`, `offsetLeft`, `offsetWidth`, and `offsetHeight` has been removed. They are now only supported on `HTMLElement`s, matching the spec. If you need similar functionality for SVG elements, use `getBoundingClientRect()` instead.

The `XMLHttpRequestProgressEvent` interface has been removed, together with the `position` and `totalSize` properties. Use the `ProgressEvent` interface with the `loaded` and total `properties` instead.

[The Google Developers blog](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/03/chrome-50-deprecations) has more details on some of these feature removals/deprecations.
