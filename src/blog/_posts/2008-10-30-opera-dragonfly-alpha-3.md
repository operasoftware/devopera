<p> Today saw the release of <a href="https://www.opera.com/products/dragonfly">Opera Dragonfly alpha 3</a>.  As it is based on web technology, you don&#39;t have to do anythingâ€”it will just update itself the next time you load it.  Key new features are DOM editing, localisation, and improved breadcrumb trail.  Full details can be found at the <a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/introducing-opera-dragonfly-alpha-3">Opera Dragonfly blog</a>. </p>
<h3>object not found error?</h3>
<p>If you get an error using Opera Dragonfly saying &quot;object not found&quot;, it&#39;s a confusion between versions. By default, if you&#39;re running a stable build of Opera,  it tries to use the latest stable version of Opera Dragonfly, while running a pre-release of Opera (alpha, beta or a weekly) tries to connect to the latest experimental version of Opera Dragonfly. Sometimes this can get confused.</p>

<p>To cure it, update &lt;URL:opera:config#DeveloperTools|DeveloperToolsURL&gt; to either of these:</p>
<ul><li>
<a href="https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/" target="_blank">https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/</a> for the latest stable version, or</li>
<li><a href="https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/cutting-edge" target="_blank">https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/cutting-edge</a> for  the latest cutting edge-build.</li>
</ul>
