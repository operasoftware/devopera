There are many reasons why it is important to test your web sites in Opera. I’m just going to focus on one here–the mobile market. The mobile web has been getting a lot more press recently, and it is a market where Opera is in a very strong position, and is moving from strength to strength. It the last quarter we announced that Opera Mini alone had over 15.8 million unique users in the month of July, up from 3.5 million in July 2007. It grew from 850 million web pages viewed to 3.7 _billion_, a year on year growth of 330%. This generated 44.5 terabytes of compressed traffic, or 296.6 terabytes if the data wasn’t compressed by the Opera Mini servers. This growth is only going to get fuelled as Opera signs more deals with operators for pre-installing Opera Mini. Away from Opera Mini, the first beta of Opera Mobile 9.5 came out recently, and it is already being shipped pre-installed on some popular high end phones.

### Operators shipping Opera Mini pre-installed

The following operators are shipping Opera Mini by default on their range of phones. We usually find that traffic and unique users go up quite a bit after we are pre-installed on operators phones. For web developers, Opera Mini being pre-installed means that you can almost guarantee that Opera Mini will be available, and it becomes much more important to support Opera on your site if a major operator in your target markets ship with Opera Mini on their phones. Some operators re-badge Opera Mini to their own branding and some keep it as Opera Mini. The browser will always report it is Opera Mini of you detect the User Agent however.

The Samsung Omnia and the HTC phones are especially well suited to mobile browsing, with large high resolution touch screens and high end specifications. Opera has also recently announced that Opera 9.5 will be included on the [NVidea Tegra family of computer-on-chip Windows Mobile and Windows CE solutions](http://www.nvidia.com/object/io_1220962341614.html). This chipset should be included on high end phones in the future.

As Opera Mini and Opera Mobile run on Opera’s Presto rendering engine, making your site work in the Opera browser will bring you a long way to being compatible with our mobile browsers, and will make your site available to the customers of all the mobile operators and device manufacturers listed above. The number of users on the mobile web and Opera Mini and Mobile will only continue to grow in the future.
