Opera 40 (based on Chromium 53) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what‚Äôs new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here‚Äôs what it means for web developers.

## Improved `<input pattern="‚Ä¶">`

[The `u` flag (which stands for Unicode)](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/es6-unicode-regex) is now applied to any regular expressions compiled through [the `pattern` attribute](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#the-pattern-attribute) for `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements.
This enables more Unicode-friendly features, and generally more sensible behavior.

	<input pattern="[üç™üéÇüç©]">
	<!--
		The input only validates when it is either üç™, üéÇ, or üç©.
		(Previously, those strings would fail validation.)
	-->

[A demo is available.](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/pattern-u)

## `<iframe sandbox="allow-presentation">`

[The Presentation API](https://w3c.github.io/presentation-api/#sandboxing-and-the-allow-presentation-keyword) defines the nw `allow-presentation` sandboxing flag for [`<iframe sandbox="‚Ä¶">`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#attr-iframe-sandbox) which gives web developers control over whether an `iframe` can start a presentation session. By default, the Presentation API is disabled in sandboxed `<iframe>`s.

## Shadow DOM v1

All browser vendors finally agreed on [the Shadow DOM spec](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/), called *v1*. The new Shadow DOM APIs include:

- `Element.attachShadow`
- `Event.prototype.composed`
- `Event.prototype.composedPath()`
- `HTMLSlotElement`
- `Slotable.prototype.assignedSlot`

For more information, check out [Hayato Ito‚Äôs overview of the differences between Shadow DOM v0 and v1](http://hayato.io/2016/shadowdomv1/).

## `MediaStreamTrack` Constraints API

The following [`MediaStreamTrack`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#mediastreamtrack) methods are now supported:

- `getCapabilities`
- `getConstraints`
- `getSettings`
- `applyConstraints`

These APIs allow getting, setting, and querying constraints on a `MediaStreamTrack`.

Additionally, [`MediaTrackConstraints`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#idl-def-mediatrackconstraints) instances now have `video` and `audio` properties.

## Promise-based `getUserMedia`

[The `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` API](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia), which returns a promise, is now supported. Also, the unprefixed version of [`navigator.getUserMedia()`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#local-content) (which uses callbacks) is now available. For more info, see [Sam Dutton‚Äôs write-up](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/media-devices#getusermedia).

## Unprefixed CSS `filter`

[The CSS `filter` property](https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/) is now supported in its unprefixed form. For now, `-webkit-filter` is still supported as an alias for `filter`. [A demo featuring SpongeBob SquarePants is available.](http://bennettfeely.com/filters/)

## CSS `-webkit-user-select: all`

Chromium already supported `-webkit-user-select`, the prefixed version of [`user-select`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#content-selection), but it didn‚Äôt recognize every value the spec defines. As of this update, the `-webkit-user-select: all` is supported. This property/value pair makes it so that if a selection would contain only part of an element, then the selection must contain the entire element including all its descendants.

For example, if you apply this on all `<p>` elements, and you then try to select a single word in a paragraph, the entire paragraph is selected automatically.

The [CSS Tricks Almanac entry for `user-select`](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/u/user-select/) features a nice demo.

## Force flattening when ancestor has opacity

3D-positioned descendants are now flattened by an ancestor that has opacity. Previously that didn‚Äôt happen if that ancestor also specified `transform-style: preserve-3d`. [A visual demo explains this better than words ever could.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-opacity-force-flattening/)

## Rasterization & `will-change: transform`

Generally, all content is re-rastered when its transform scale changes, unless `will-change: transform` is applied to it. In other words, `will-change: transform` effectively means ‚Äúplease apply the transformation quickly, without taking the additional time for rasterization‚Äù. This only applies to scaling that happens via JavaScript manipulation, and does not apply to CSS animations. For more information, see the [technical summary for this change](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f8WS99F9GORWP_m74l_JfsTHgCrHkbEorHYu72D4Xag/edit?usp=sharing). [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-will-change-transform-rasterization/)

## Deprecated and removed features

Synthetic events (i.e. those who are created by JavaScript, and are thus untrusted) are now prevented from executing their default action. `click` is the only exception for backwards compatibility with legacy content. This change matches [the spec](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#trusted-events) and other browsers.

[The HTML spec](https://github.com/whatwg/html/commit/99f0f1ae017523276ea4dd5784ec63a23a23834d) was changed so that `<label>` elements aren‚Äôt form-associated elements anymore. As a result, support for the `form` attribute on `<label>` elements was removed, and `labelElement.form` is now an alias for `labelElement.control.form` (instead of mapping to the `form` attribute value).

HTTP/0.9, the predecessor to HTTP/1.x, is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. Its replacement, HTTP/1.0, was standardized 20 years ago.

Support for DHE-based TLS ciphers has been removed, after being [deprecated in Chromium 51 & Opera 38](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-38/#deprecated-and-removed-features). Servers should upgrade to ECDHE ciphers instead.

A long time ago, [the File API spec](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/) was changed to remove the `FileError` interface. It has been deprecated since 2013. As we‚Äôre preparing to remove this interface entirely in a future release, any usage of `FileError` now triggers a warning in the DevTools console.

[The TextEncoder API](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#textencoder) no longer accepts an argument that specifies the encoding. Instead, it always uses UTF-8. If an argument is passed, it is ignored. This means that `new TextEncoder('utf-16')` and `new TextEncoder('utf-16be')` no longer work.
