Almost four months after its initial <a href="http://labs.opera.com/news/2009/06/16/">Labs release</a> and several <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/">snapshots</a> later, we’re happy to announce our <a href="https://www.opera.com/browser/next/">Opera 10.10 beta with Opera Unite</a>.<br/><br/>For this release, we’ve brushed up our <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-unite-developer-primer-revisited/">Opera Unite developer primer</a>, and Zi Bin has written an introduction to <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/yusef-the-unite-server-framework/">Yusef, the Opera Unite Server framework</a>.<br/><br/>Shwetank has also been working on building his own <a href="http://unite.opera.com/application/421/">Opera Unite Task Manager application</a> — see his <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/10/13/a-close-up-look-at-developing-your-own-opera-unite-application">earlier entry</a> on the <abbr title="Opera Developer Network">ODIN</abbr> blog for more details and some handy tips.<br/><br/>Note that this release does not include a fix for the <code>@font-face</code> <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/the-opera-10-experience/#webfontsissue">font descriptor bug</a> just yet. We’re still working on a fix, but it takes a bit longer than expected.<br/><br/>So, check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eak_o_1Kzd0&amp;feature=player_embedded">video</a> for this release, play with the <a href="https://www.opera.com/browser/next/">beta release</a>, and get started with building your own Opera Unite application. And of course, let us know what you think on the <a href="https://dev.opera.com/forums/">Dev.Opera forums</a>.<br/><br/><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" style="width:560px; height:340px;" data=""><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Eak_o_1Kzd0" />
