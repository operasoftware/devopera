<p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">SVG Working Group</a> has publish the Last Call of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-SVGMobile12-20080915/">SVG Tiny 1.2</a> working draft.  It is welcoming comments until the 13<sup>th</sup> of October.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/News/2008#item158"><p>Its goal is to provide the ability to create a whole range of graphical content, from static images to animations to interactive Web applications.</p></blockquote>

<p>SVG Tiny 1.2 is an update of the SVG Tiny 1.1 spec, and the Working Group hope to get the specification finished soon.  The Tiny profile is a subset of the SVG Full 1.2 spec.  Opera’s own <a href="http://my.opera.com/MacDev_ed/blog/">Erik Dahlström</a> is a key member of the Working Group, and Opera’s SVG implementer.  Opera 9.5 supports <a href="http://www.codedread.com/svg-support.php">93.8%</a> of the SVG Full 1.1 test suite—the highest of any browser—and has some preliminary support for SVG Tiny 1.2.  This includes the <code>animation</code>, <code>handler</code>, <code>solidColor</code> and <code>textArea</code> elements and a whole host of attributes, CSS properties and DOM interfaces.  Check <a href="https://www.opera.com/docs/specs/#graphics">the SVG specs supported in 9.5</a> for more information on what SVG Tiny 1.2 is supported already.</p>
