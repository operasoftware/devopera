Opera 31 (based on Chromium 44) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what‚Äôs new for users, see [our Desktop blog](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/2015/08/opera-31-speeds-up/). Here‚Äôs what it means for web developers.

## CSS multi-column layout

Chromium now includes a brand new implementation of [multi-column layout](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-multicol/) by Opera engineer Morten Stenshorne, solving historic issues with incorrect column balancing and interaction with compositing (hardware-accelerated layers). While it might have been possible to solve that in the old implementation, there was another big problem with the old implementation, code-wise: it needed a lot of hooks and special code in central layout code. The new implementation gives better support, and cleaner code that‚Äôs easier to maintain.

Note that for now, the `-webkit-` prefix is still required when using column layout-related styles.

A [multi-column demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/multi-column-css/) is available.

## `document.scrollingElement`

Browsers disagree on whether `html` or `body` reflects the viewport for `scrollTop` et al. Some sites are using UA sniffing to decide which to use. Browsers want to align and use `html` (in standards mode), so sites that UA sniff need to be changed. To assist with this transition, Chromium now implements [the `document.scrollingElement` API](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#dom-document-scrollingelement). Developers can now use that, falling back to [a polyfill](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/document.scrollingElement) or whatever solution they were using previously.

See [Simon‚Äôs write-up on fixing the `scrollTop` bug](https://dev.opera.com/articles/fixing-the-scrolltop-bug/) for more background.

## ES6 computed property names

ES6 computed property names enable specifying properties in object literals whose names are the result of expressions rather than just hardcoded identifiers or strings.

	const prefix = 'foo';

	const object = {
		[prefix + 'bar']: 'Hello',
		[`${prefix}baz`]: 'world'
	};

	`${object.foobar} ${object.foobaz}!`;
	// ‚Üí 'Hello world!'

## ES6 Unicode code point escapes

[Unicode code point escapes](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-escapes#unicode-code-point) such as `\u{1F389}` are now supported in string and template literals. This way, any symbol can be escaped using its Unicode code point.

Before ES6, JavaScript supported the so-called ‚ÄúUnicode escape sequences‚Äù of the form `\uXXXX` which only allowed up to 4 hexadecimal digits. Code points requiring more than four hexadecimal digits, (such as the immensely important [party popper emoji](https://codepoints.net/U+1F389 "U+1F389 PARTY POPPER")), had to be represented using UCS-2/UTF-16 surrogate pairs.

	// Let‚Äôs represent the U+1F389 PARTY POPPER Unicode symbol
	// in a JavaScript string using escape sequences.

	// In ES5, we‚Äôd have to calculate the surrogates manually,
	// and use two separate escape sequences:
	console.log('\uD83C\uDF89');
	// 'üéâ'

	// In ES6, we don‚Äôt have to calculate anything ‚Äî we can
	// simply use Unicode code point escapes:
	console.log('\u{1F389}');
	// 'üéâ'

## `Cache.prototype.add(request)`

[The `add` method on `Cache` instances](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#cache-add) is now supported. `add` takes [a `RequestInfo` object](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requestinfo), fetches it, and then adds the resulting response object to the cache.

## `Request.prototype.context`

The read-only [`context` property of the `Request` interface](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#requestcontext) contains the context of the request (e.g. `'audio'`, `'image'`, `'iframe'`). This indicates what sort of resource is being fetched.

The `context` of a request is only relevant in the ServiceWorker API. A service worker can make decisions based on whether the URL is for an image, or an embeddable object such as a `<video>`, `<iframe>`, etc.

## Web Audio API updates

Matching a change in [the Web Audio API specification](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/), the `buffer` property of an `AudioBufferSourceNode` can no longer be set more than once. This protects developers from the lack of control over when the new source starts. Previously ([as of Chromium 42 and Opera 29](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-29/#web-audio-api-updates)), if the `buffer` property is assigned to more than once, a deprecation message was logged to the DevTools console. Now, doing so throws an error.

The channel order of [`ChannelMergerNode`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#idl-def-ChannelMergerNode) is now static after instantiation, matching the latest spec. This change addresses [various](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/304) [issues](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues/459) with the previous implementation.
