Opera 39 (based on Chromium 52) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## ES2016 exponentiation operator

ES2016 introduces [an arithmetic operator equivalent](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-exp-operator) of `Math.pow(base, exponent)`, in which the lefthand-side expression serves as the base value, and the righthand-side expression serves as the exponent.

	4 ** 3;
	// → 64

	let value = 4;
	value **= 3;
	value;
	// → 64

## Fetch API: `Response` construction with `ReadableStream`

It’s now possible to construct your own `ReadableStream` instances and to use them as bodies for `Response` objects, including from within service workers. This functionality is part of [the Fetch standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/). See [Jeff Posnick’s write-up](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/sw-readablestreams) for details, or [Jake Archibald’s](https://jakearchibald.com/2016/streams-ftw/) in-depth blog post on streams for even more info.

## Fetch API: referrer policy

Requests made using [the Fetch API](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/) can use a specific referrer policy, which affects the value of the `Referer` HTTP header that’s sent to remote servers. This can be done by adding a `referrerPolicy` property to the options object passed to `fetch`, which accepts the following values:

* `'no-referrer'`
* `'no-referrer-when-downgrade'`
* `'origin'`
* `'origin-when-cross-origin'`
* `'unsafe-url'`

See [Ehsan Akhgari’s write-up](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/03/referrer-and-cache-control-apis-for-fetch/) for a straight-forward  explanation of these values.

	fetch(url, { 'referrerPolicy': 'no-referrer' })
		.then(function(response) {
			// Do something with the `response`…
		});

[A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/fetch-api/fetch-referrer-policy.html)

## 2D canvas filters

`CanvasRenderingContext2D` instances now support the `filter` property that applies effects to primitives drawn to the canvas. The `filter` value is parsed in the same way as [CSS filters](https://drafts.fxtf.org/filters/#FilterProperty).

	const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas');
	const context = canvas.getContext('2d');
	context.filter = 'saturate(6.3)';

## `createImageBitmap` options

An `ImageBitmapOptions` object is an `options` object that can be passed to `createImageBitmap()`.

	createImageBitmap(image, options).then(function(response) {
		// Do something with the `response`…
	});

The available options are:

* `colorSpaceConversion` indicates whether the image is decoded using color space conversion. Either `'none'` or `'default'` (default). The value `'default'` indicates that implementation-specific behavior is used.
* `imageOrientation` indicates whether the image is presented as-is or flipped vertically. Either `'flipY'` or `'none'` (default).
* `premultiplyAlpha` indicates that the bitmap color channels are premultiplied by the alpha channel. One of `'none'`, `'premultiply'`, or `'default'` (default).
* `resizeWidth` indicates the new width.
* `resizeHeight` indicates the new height.
* `resizeQuality` specifies an image scaling algorithm. One of `'pixelated'`, `high'`, `'medium'`, or `'low'` (default).

## Invalid `<track kind>` values are no longer treated as subtitles

Invalid values for [`<track kind>`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#attr-track-kind) were previously treated as `'subtitles'`. This means that any new values would be treated as subtitles by old browsers. Chromium now uses `'metadata'` instead as the “invalid value default”, to avoid browsers showing `<track>`s with unrecognized values.

## `HTMLMediaElement.prototype.srcObject`

The `srcObject` property on HTMLMediaElement instances enables associating a `MediaStream` to a media element using a simple assignment. Previously, achieving this required first obtaining a URL associated to the `MediaStream`, and then associating this URL to the media element.

Currently, only `MediaStream` objects are accepted because it is the only type currently supported by other major browsers, but Chromium aims to support more types in the future. (Per the spec, a `MediaProvider` can be a `MediaStream`, a `MediaSource`, or a `Blob`.)

## Web Audio updates

[`AudioParam` instances](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioParam) now have readonly `minValue` and `maxValue` properties that specify the minimum and maximum values the `AudioParam` can have. The `value` is clamped to lie in this range

Automation methods for the position and orientation coordinates of [`PannerNode`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-pannernode-interface) and the `position{X,Y,Z}`, `up{X,Y,Z}`, and `forward{X,Y,Z}` vectors of [`AudioListener`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioListener) are now available. This allows smooth changes in the coordinates using `AudioParam` methods.

Chromium now implements the `reduction` property on `DynamicsCompressorNode` instances as a readonly float, matching the spec. Previously, the value was represented as an `AudioParam`.

## `IDBKeyRange.prototype.includes()`

[The `includes` method on `IDBKeyRange` instances](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#dom-idbkeyrange-includes) tests whether or not a key exists within the bounds of the range. Until all other browsers support this natively, [a polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBKeyRange/includes#Polyfill) can be used.

## WebRTC: Storing `RTCCertificate`s in IndexedDB

[`RTCCertificate`s](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#rtccertificate-interface) are self-signed certificates used in the DTLS handshake when setting up a connection with an `RTCPeerConnection`. Chromium now allows web applications to store `RTCCertificate`s by implementing the structured clone algorithm. This means `RTCCertificate`s can be saved and loaded from an IndexedDB database, saving the cost of generating new certificates for new sessions.

## `MediaStreamTrack` Constraints API

The following [`MediaStreamTrack`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#mediastreamtrack) methods are now supported:

* `getCapabilities`
* `getConstraints`
* `getSettings`
* `applyConstraints`

These APIs allow getting, setting, and querying constraints on a `MediaStreamTrack`.

Additionally, [`MediaTrackConstraints`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#idl-def-mediatrackconstraints) instances now have `video` and `audio` properties.

## Performance Observer

[The Performance Observer API](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#the-performanceobserver-interface) is essentially a streaming interface that can be used to gather low-level timing information asynchronously, as it’s gathered by the browser. [Marc Cohen’s write-up](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/performance-observer) does a great job explaining it.

## Pause event loop during modal dialogs

When using `alert()`, `confirm()` or `onbeforeunload`, Chromium’s old behavior was to block JavaScript while waiting for the result, but to allow all declarative animations to continue. As of this update, Chromium makes all main-thread tasks (such as `<marquee>` and CSS 2D animations) also [pause](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#pause) during this interval.

[Here’s a demo](https://jsfiddle.net/v07nfvf9/) showing the impact of `alert()` on a CSS 2D animation.

## CSS: alpha channel for RGB colors in hex notation

The CSS color parser now supports [RGB colors in hex notation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#hex-notation) consisting of 8 (`#RRGGBBAA`) or 4 (`#RGBA`) digits.

For example, `#0000FFCC` or `#00FC` are equivalent to `rgba(0, 0, 255, 204)`, a slightly-transparent blue.

[A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-alpha-channel/)

## CSS `contain`ment

[The CSS `contain` property](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-containment/#contain-property) indicates that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree. This allows the browser to recalculate layout (`contain: layout`), style (`contain: style`), paint (`contain: paint`), size (`contain: size`), or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page. For more details, [check out Paul Lewis’ explanation](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/css-containment).

## CSS `font-variant-caps` & `font-variant-numeric`

The CSS properties [`font-variant-caps`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/#font-variant-caps-prop) and [`font-variant-numeric`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts/#font-variant-caps-numeric) are now supported.

## `meter { -webkit-appearance: none; }`

Previously, there was no way to completely disable the browser’s default rendering of `<meter>` elements and to restyle them using CSS. As of Chrome 52 / Opera 39, this finally became possible using [`-webkit-appearance: none`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-4/#appearance-switching).

## New CSS Flexbox behavior for absolutely-positioned children

The static position of absolutely-positioned children used to be set as though they were a 0×0 flex item. [The CSS Flexible Box Layout spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox/#abspos-items) has since been updated to [take such children fully out of flow](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/absolute-positioned-children) and to set the static position based on `align` and `justify` properties. [Check out the demo.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-flexbox-abspos/)

## Alternative Services

[Alternative Services](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7838) allow an origin serving an `http://` or `https://` resource to nominate additional origins that the client can choose to request the resource from instead when making subsequent requests. This can be used, for example, as a protocol upgrade mechanism, for connection pooling, or for load balancing.

This is done through the `Alt-Used` HTTP header.

For example, if the resource at `https://origin.example.com/foo` returns the following response headers:

	Alt-Used: https://alternate.example.net

…and `https://origin.example.com/bar` is requested afterwards, then the browser may fetch either `https://origin.example.com/bar` or `https://alternate.example.net/bar`.

## CSP3 `strict-dynamic`

[The `'strict-dynamic'` source expression](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#strict-dynamic-usage) allows scripts loaded via nonce- or hash-based whitelists to load other scripts. Deploying CSP is now simpler than ever before. [A demo is available.](https://csp-experiments.appspot.com/unsafe-dynamic)

## Deprecated and removed features

`X-Frame-Options` is now ignored when present inside a `<meta>` tag, e.g. `<meta http-equiv="X-Frame-Options" contents="DENY">`, matching [the spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034#section-4). Use an HTTP header (`X-Frame-Options: DENY`) instead.

A non-standard and little-used variant of the `postMessage()` API is being deprecated, specifically `postMessage(message, transferables, targetOrigin)`. Use `postMessage(message, targetOrigin, transferables)` instead.

The `ended` event & property and the `onended` event handler have been removed from [the Media Capture and Streams spec](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/) and are now being deprecated in Chromium.
