Opera 57 (based on Chromium 70) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To
find out what’s new for users, see our
[Desktop blog post](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/11/opera-57-stable).
Here’s what it means for web developers.

## Displaying a dialog will cause pages to leave fullscreen

Dialogs (authentication prompt, payment request etc.) require proper context
when shown to the user. When the browser is in fullscreen mode - an immersive
mode - that context is not available. To help the user get the right context
when a dialog is displayed, the browser will now leave fullscreen mode in those
cases.

## The `ontouch*` APIs default to disabled on desktop platforms

The `ontouch*` event attributes on `Window`, `Document` and `Element` are
now disabled by default on desktop platforms. This is to avoid confusion when
feature detecting touch support - use `navigator.maxTouchPoints` for
touchscreen detection and `window.TouchEvent` touch event detection instead. To
support both touch and mouse input, consider using the [Pointer Events](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/) API.

Event listeners for the associated touch events can still be added via
`EventTarget.prototype.addEventListener`, like:

    document.addEventListener("touchstart", ...);

## Options dictionary for `postMessage` methods

An optional [`PostMessageOptions` dictionary](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#postmessageoptions)
can now be passed to the
[`postMessage`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#dom-window-postmessage-options)
method on `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`, `Worker`, `ServiceWorker`, `ServiceWorker`, and `Window`.

Thus what was previously written as:

    window.postMessage('my message', 'https://origin.example.com');

can now also be written as:

    window.postMessage('my message', { targetOrigin: 'https://origin.example.com' });

## Media and Real-time Communications

* [RTCPeerConnection.prototype.getConfiguration](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-getconfiguration)
  has been added to allow accessing the last configuration set by
  [RTCPeerConnection.prototype.setConfiguration](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcpeerconnection-setconfiguration).
* The `Opus` codec is now supported in mp4 (ISO-BMFF) containers with Media Source Extensions (MSE).
* The new SourceBuffer.changeType() method allows for improved cross-codec or cross-bytestream transitions
  within a SourceBuffer. It would for example allow changing the type of media bytes append to a media stream.

## Network

### Intervention Reports

An "intervention" happens when the user agent (the browser) willfully violates
the request of a web application in order to improve performance, security or
eliminate behavior that is considered annoying to a user. These interventions
can now be reported back to the page author either by using the
[`Report-To` HTTP Response header](https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#header) or the
[`ReportingObserver` API](https://w3c.github.io/reporting/#observers).

### TLS 1.3

[TLS 1.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446) is a new version of the TLS
protocol that sports a simpler, less error-prone design which improves both
efficiency and security. This is achieved by, among other things, reducing the
number of round-trips needed to setup a connection, and remove a number of
insecure legacy options.

## Layout / CSS

* The `<rp>` element is now `display: none` by default even outside a `<ruby>` element.
* The behavior of percentage row tracks and gutters in grid containers with
indefinite heights has been updated, and now behaves the same as (grid) columns.

## Miscellaneous

### `Symbol.prototype.description`

`Symbol.prototype.description` provides a more straight-forward way to access
the description of a `Symbol` rather than the previously more indirect access
via `Symbol.prototype.toString`.

### WebUSB on Dedicated Workers

The WebUSB feature can now be accessed from within a dedicated worker. This for
example allows communication with an USB device to be offloaded from the main
thread - which can improve performance.

## Removed features

### AppCache in non-secure contexts

The Application Cache feature, after having been deprecated since Opera 54
(Chromium 67), is no longer exposed in non-secure contexts.

### Anonymous getter on HTMLFrameSetElement

It was previously possible to access `<frame>` elements by name via their
parent `<frameset>`. This was a non-standard extension, which has now been
removed.

## Deprecated features

### Custom Elements "V0" and Shadow DOM "V0"

The "V0" versions of the Custom Elements and Shadow DOM APIs has been
deprecated, and is expected to be removed in Opera 60 (Chromium 73). Please
watch out for deprecation warnings and migrate any usage to the "V1" APIs:

* [Custom Elements "V1"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#custom-elements)
* [Shadow DOM "V1"](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/)

At the time of writing, the latter specification is in the process of being
split up and included into the [DOM Standard](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/),
[HTML Standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/) and [CSS Scoping](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/).

To understand what the differences are between "V0" and "V1" of Shadow DOM, see
[What's New in Shadow DOM v1 (by examples)](https://hayato.io/2016/shadowdomv1/)
by Hayato Ito, for a very thorough list.

### HTML Imports

[HTML Imports](http://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/imports/) allowed
importing HTML documents into other HTML documents. This feature was never
widely supported, and is thus being deprecated. Like Custom Elements "V0" and
Shadow DOM "V0" above, it's also expected to be removed in Opera 60 (Chromium 73).

## What's next?

If you're interested in experimenting with features that are in the
pipeline for future versions of Opera, we recommend following
[our Opera Developer stream](https://www.opera.com/developer).

You can also see features that we and other Chromium/Blink
contributors are working on by looking at the [Chrome Platform
Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/features) page.
