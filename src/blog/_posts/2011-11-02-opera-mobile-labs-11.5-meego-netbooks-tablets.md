Since releasing [Opera Mobile 11.5 for Android][3] earlier this month, we have been working on an updated Labs release for MeeGo netbooks and tablets running Intel Atom processors.

Aside from the changes you may have seen on our Android release, this build contains a nifty hybrid mouse/touch input method which adds support for mouseover events while still working on touchscreens. To try it out, use the `-usehybridinput` command line argument when launching.

As with other Labs releases, this build has not gone through full release testing, but it should work well enough to have some fun with. To install, [download this package][4], and run the following command in a root terminal on your device:

[4]: https://www.opera.com/download/get.pl?sub=++++&id=34191&location=270&nothanks=yes

		rpm -i Opera_Mobile-Labs-MeeGo-11.50-42.i386.rpm

Or, if you have a previous version of Opera Mobile installed:

		rpm -e Opera_Mobile-MeeGo
		rpm -U Opera_Mobile-Labs-MeeGo-11.50-42.i386.rpm

Alternatively, if your MeeGo install has the [Intel’s AppUp store][5], you should be able to find Opera Mobile there as a free download as well.
