<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Nicholas#The_Netherlands.2C_Belgium.2C_and_Lower_Rhineland_.28Germany.29">Saint Nicholas</a> present from the desktop team: a <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam/blog/2010/12/06/extension-improvements-updates-to-core-and-some-other-nice-fixes">snapshot build</a> with better SVG performance, improved <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#forms">HTML5 Forms</a> support, and Opera extension debugging from Opera Dragonfly.</p>
<h3>HTML5 forms</h3>
<p><img src="{{ page.id }}/wobbly.png" alt="Wobbly error popups" title="Wobbly error popups in Opera 9.*-10.6* and Opera 11" style="float: right;" />We&#39;ve cleaned up our old web forms implementation from 2005 — first introduced in <a href="https://www.opera.com/docs/history/#o90">Opera 9.0tp</a> —, so as to align it with the current HTML5 spec and prettify things a bit.</p>
<p>One of the most visual improvements is the &quot;wobbly bubbles&quot; theme replacing the previous square error dropdowns, which Bruce shared a <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/html5-forms-error-reporting-with-wobbly-bubbles">sneak peek</a> of back in October. The wording of the error messages has also been tweaked so as to sound more natural.</p>
<p>In addition, we have now added support for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/common-input-element-attributes.html#the-placeholder-attribute"><code>placeholder</code></a> attribute, and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#text-state-and-search-state">Search</a>, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#telephone-state">Telephone</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/number-state.html#color-state">Color</a> states, with the latter popping up a nice color picker. We&#39;ve also added support for the new HTML5 <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-button-element.html#the-progress-element"><code>progress</code></a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/the-button-element.html#the-meter-element"><code>meter</code></a> elements, <del>and support upload of multiple files</del>. You can try out these new additions on <a href="http://people.opera.com/andreasb/odin/html5forms_o11.html">this simple demo page</a>.</p>
<h3>SVG improvements</h3>
<p>We&#39;ve been tweaking parts of our SVG engine, which should give things a bit of a performance boost. We&#39;ve also added support for the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/struct.html#SVGElementTimelineBegin"><code>timelineBegin</code></a> attribute, which controls the initialization of the timeline for the document. If you look at <a href="http://dahlström.net/svg/smil/lennon-google-smil.svg">this 11.1MB SMIL example</a>, you&#39;ll notice Opera 11 will start playing the animation while the rest of the file is still being downloaded.</p>
<h3>Extension debugging with Opera Dragonfly</h3>
<p>In the last couple of desktop builds, we&#39;ve been improving the developer experience step by step, so as to smoothen the rough edges in the <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/view/opera-extensions-developer-workflow/">extensions development workflow</a>. One missing piece in the puzzle is getting Opera Dragonfly to work properly with extensions. This build is a first step to achieve that: you&#39;ll find that the debug context dropdown now has a new &quot;Opera Extensions and Opera Unite&quot; section listing all background processes, and the script dropdown now distinguishes between document scripts, BrowserJS, UserJS and the extension runtimes. However, there are still a number of issues that need to be resolved, so tread with caution. If you have feedback, use the <a href="https://www.opera.com/dragonfly/feedback/">the Bug Wizard and forums</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth mentioning that David has <a href="http://my.opera.com/dragonfly/blog/2010/12/03/getting-opera-dragonfly-ready-for-opera-11">posted more details</a> about these and other Opera Dragonfly features on the project&#39;s blog. Note that for now, you have to set the <a href="https://dragonfly.opera.com/app/cutting-edge/">cutting-edge</a> path in <a href="opera:config#DeveloperTools|DeveloperToolsURL">opera:config#DeveloperTools|DeveloperToolsURL</a> in order for the above features to become available.</p>
