<p>Last week I was privileged to talk to students at several <abbr>UK</abbr> universities and present on Web Standards, why they&#39;re vital for cross-device development, accessibility and keeping the Web genuinely <strong>world</strong>-wide, as well as give a preview of some emerging standards like <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5. Thanks to all who came to listen, asked questions and came for a beer afterwards, and to all the lecturers who invited and welcomed us.</p>
<p>A zip of the Opera Show presentation <a href="{{ page.id }}/opera-uk-tour.zip">&quot;Web Standards for the Future&quot; (ZIP 4.6 MB)</a> is available for your viewing pleasure, although to see the examples of the <code>video</code> element, you&#39;ll need the &quot;All Together Now&quot;  preview <a href="http://labs.opera.com/downloads/">video build of Opera</a>.</p>
<p>My friend <a href="http://my.opera.com/chrismills/blog/">Chris Mills</a> has given a  customised version that expands more on <a href="{{ page.id }}/University_Tour_with_extra_mobile.zip">mobile development (ZIP  4.5 MB)</a>.

<p>Lecturers and students are welcome to post these on Intranets, departmental or computer science club sites.</p>
<p>Those who were interested in the content about the mobile web in the developing world may be interested in  &quot;<a href="https://www.opera.com/mobile_report/2008/09/">Eyes on Africa</a>&quot;, our report which shows mobile web use in Africa has grown by 558% between September 2007 and September 2008, as well as our other <a href="https://www.opera.com/mobile_report/2008/09/">mobile web reports</a>.</p></p>
