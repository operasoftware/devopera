A few weeks ago, I had the pleasure to [give a talk](https://opbeat.com/events/web-rebels-2016/#towards-better-apps-the-what-why-of-progressive-web-apps) about progressive web apps at the [Web Rebels conference](https://www.webrebels.org/) in Oslo. If you want to get a quick intro to the what and why of progressive web apps, do check it out.

Last week, I [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMxQ0fhj89I) at Google’s [Progressive Web App Dev Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/progressive-web-app-dev-summit/) in Amsterdam. In my talk, I covered novel UX patterns in progressive web apps, emerging markets and Opera Mini compatibility, and introduced a couple of [new ideas](https://dev.opera.com/blog/pwa-badge-pop/) to solve some of the discoverability issues progressive web apps struggle with.

My talk there was followed by a [browser panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyyEfxrk_NU), in which I participated as well. You can find a video of it below.
