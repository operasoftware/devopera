Opera 44 (based on Chromium 57) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## CSS Grid

CSS Grid is now available. CSS Grid supports a two-dimensional grid-based layout system, optimized
for responsive user interface design. Elements within the grid can be specified to span multiple
columns or rows. Elements positioned in a CSS grid can also be named, making layout code easier to
understand. There are lots of excellent resources available to learn more:

* [Learn CSS Grid](http://jensimmons.com/post/feb-27-2017/learn-css-grid) &mdash; an awesome compilation of resources by Jen Simmons.
* [Can I use CSS Grid Layout](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid)
* [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) on MDN.
* [CSS Grid – Table layout is back. Be there and be square.](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/01/css-grid) by Surma.
* [CSS Grid Layout: A New Layout Module for the Web](https://webkit.org/blog/7434/css-grid-layout-a-new-layout-module-for-the-web/) by Manuel Rego.

## WebAssembly

The WebAssembly API has been enabled by default, allowing developers to run near-native code in the
browser without a plugin. WebAssembly is essentially a better replacement for
[asm.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js). We believe it has the potential to bring browser
games to the next level.

## Credential Management

Opera 44 also adds support for the [Credential Management
API](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management/). This gives
users a simpler sign-in process across devices and provides websites with more control over the
usage of credentials. The website can use password-based sign-ins via this API. Once logged in,
users will be automatically signed back into a site, even if their session has expired.

## Other CSS features

* The [`caret-color`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/caret-color) property enables developers to specify the color of the text input cursor.
* [`text-decoration-skip: ink`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration-skip) can be used to make underlines skip descenders, the portion of letters that extend below the text's baseline.
* New [`text-decoration`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration) properties are now available, allowing developers to specify visual effects such as line color and style.

## Audio/video

* The new [`AudioContext.getOutputTimestamp()`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-AudioContext-getOutputTimestamp-AudioTimestamp) method enables developers to synchronize `DOMHighResTimeStamp` and `AudioContext.currentTime` values.
* `AudioBufferSourceNode`, `OscillatorNode`, and `ConstantSourceNode` now inherit from [`AudioScheduledSourceNode`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioScheduledSourceNode), consolidating functionality.
* The new [`cancelAndHoldAtTime`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-AudioParam-cancelAndHoldAtTime-AudioParam-double-cancelTime) function cancels future `AudioParam` events with times greater than or equal to `cancelTime`, allowing developers to preserve the value of the scheduled time in a direct way.
* Developers can now construct WebAudio-specific events such as [`OfflineAudioCompletionEvent`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#OfflineAudioCompletionEvent) and [`AudioProcessingEvent`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#the-audioprocessingevent-interface---deprecated).

## Other JS and DOM features

* The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) [`Response`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) class now supports the [.redirected](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/redirected) attribute to help web developers avoid untrustworthy responses and reduce the risk of [open redirectors](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html).
* The new [`padStart`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padStart) and [`padEnd`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/padEnd) formatting tools enable text padding, facilitating tasks like aligning console output or printing numbers with a fixed number of digits.
* To preserve consistency with other `on<event>` attributes, `ongotpointercapture` and `onlostpointercapture` are now part of the `GlobalEventHandlers` mixin.

## Improved interoperability

* `fieldset.elements` now returns an [`HTMLCollection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection) instead of an [`HTMLFormControlsCollection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormControlsCollection) to better align with spec.
* The `usemap` attribute now requires case-sensitive matching.
* Custom message events and events created by [`client.postMessage(message, transfer)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Client/postMessage) in a service worker will now use [`MessageEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent) instead of [`ServiceWorkerMessageEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerMessageEvent).

## Deprecated and removed features

* Support for the `<keygen>` element has been removed, causing it to no longer display any controls nor submit form element data, to align with other browsers.
* Locally-trusted SHA-1 certificates will now result in a certificate error page.
* The `<cursor>` element has been removed, but cursor icons can still be set via the [`cursor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) CSS property.
* A legacy caller has been removed from [`HTMLEmbedElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLEmbedElement) and [`HTMLObjectElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLObjectElement), so the interfaces will now throw exceptions rather than having their instances called as functions.
* All `webkit`-prefixed IndexedDB global aliases have been removed, after their deprecation in M38 (Opera 25).
* Support for `webkitClearResourceTimings()`, `webkitSetResourceTimingBufferSize()`, and `onwebkitresourcetimingbufferfull` has been removed from the [`Performance`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance) interface, in favor of `clearResourceTimings()`, `setResourceTimingBufferSize()`, and `onresourcetimingbufferfull`.
* The `-internal-media-controls-text-track-list*` and related pseudo-elements are deprecated and will be removed in M59 (Opera 46). Use custom controls for custom text track selection.
* Support for the obsolete API `webkitCancelRequestAnimationFrame` has been removed in favor of [`cancelAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/cancelAnimationFrame).
* The `webkit` prefix has been removed from `AudioContext` and `OfflineAudioContext`.
