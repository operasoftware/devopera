<p>I spoke at Open Source Conference (OSCON) on using <abbr>HTML</abbr> 5 today. A kind audience member videoed the  talk.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://my.opera.com/chooseopera/blog/2009/07/29/bruce-lawson-from-opera-the-html-5-experiments">45 minute video, slides (with links to the demos) are all available</a> (I&#39;m linking to another Opera page in order to keep comments together).</p>

<p>I gave a longer version of the talk at Stanford University, in which I discussed accessibility of the <abbr>HTML</abbr> spec, and overlaps with WAI-ARIA. (<a href="http://people.opera.com/brucel/talks/2009/stanford.odp">Slides, .ODP 2MB</a>.)</p>
