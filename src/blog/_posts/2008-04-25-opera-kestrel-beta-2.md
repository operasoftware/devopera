This week we released an exciting new beta release of Kestrel, the new Opera desktop browser — Beta 2, to be exact. It’s got some exciting new additions, such as support for full CSS3 selectors and HSL, support for MathML, further speed optimizations, support for HTML5’s `getElementsByClassName`, and improved synchronization of bookmarks, Speed Dial sites, and other settings through Opera Link.

You can download the beta and start playing around with it right away, and find more out about its features at the [Opera desktop product page][1].
