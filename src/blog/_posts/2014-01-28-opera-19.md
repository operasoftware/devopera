Hot on the heels of last week’s [Opera 19 for Android](https://www.opera.com/mobile/android) release, [Opera 19 for Mac and Windows](https://www.opera.com/computer) (based on Chromium 32) is out! Here’s what that means for web developers.

## JavaScript Promises

[JavaScript Promises](http://ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-promise-objects) are now enabled by default. Promises provide a convenient way to get access to the result of an operation in JavaScript, regardless of whether that operation is synchronous or asynchronous. Here’s a silly example that demonstrates the main functionality:

	var promise = new Promise(function(resolve) {
		setTimeout(function() {
			resolve('The time machine worked!');
		}, 2014); // see what I did there?
	});

	promise.then(function(result) {
		console.log('Promise resolved.', result);
	});

Jake Archibald has written [an in-depth article on JavaScript Promises](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/), so check that out if you’re looking for more info or examples.

## Animated WebP images

[The animated WebP image format](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/faq#why_should_i_use_animated_webp) is an alternative to animated GIF that offers higher image quality at smaller file sizes. Opera 19 enables support for animated WebP.

<figure block="figure">
	<img elem="media" src="{{ page.id }}/animated-webp-supported.webp" alt="Your browser supports animated WebP images." onerror="src='{{ page.id }}/animated-webp-not-supported.png';alt='Your browser does not support animated WebP images.';this.onerror=null">
</figure>

## High-performance opaque 2D context for `<canvas>`

Whenever you use `<canvas>`, and you only use non-alpha-modifying canvas commands, Opera can now optimize the blending and culling of obscured elements when compositing the canvas into the page.

To enable this behavior, pass in an object as the second parameter to the canvas element’s `getContext` method, setting the `alpha` property to `false` (rather than `true`, which is the implied default):

	var context = document.querySelector('canvas').getContext('2d', {
		'alpha': false
	});

## More extension APIs

Opera 19 for Desktop adds the following APIs to extensions:

* [`chrome.fontSettings`](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/fontSettings.html)
* [`chrome.power`](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/power.html)

See [our Opera 15+ extensions documentation](https://dev.opera.com/extension-docs/) for in-depth discussion of these APIs.

If you’re interested in experimenting with features that are in the pipeline for future versions of Opera, we recommend following [our Opera Developer stream](https://www.opera.com/developer).
