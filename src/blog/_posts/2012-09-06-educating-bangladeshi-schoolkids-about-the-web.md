<p>I&#39;ve written before about our <a href="http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/opera-and-grameenphone-in-bangladesh">Bangladeshi version of Opera Mini</a>, in which we partnered with Grameenphone which is <a href="http://www.grameenphone.com/about-us/corporate-information/ownership-structure" target="_blank">owned</a> by Telenor and a non-profit sister concern of <a href="http://www.grameen-info.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=175">Grameen Bank</a> - a Nobel Prize-winning Bangladeshi institution that gives microloans to the rural poor (mostly women) to help them out of poverty. (95% of the bank is owned by its borrowers, of whom 97% are women.)</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.opera.com/smw/2012/07/">Asia-Pacific State of the Mobile Web report</a>  shows that the number of Bangladeshi Opera Mini users doubled between July 2011 and July 2012, with the top 10 handsets all Nokia models.</p>
<p>We also co-sponsored the 2011 i-Gen program, an educational program and competition designed to increase Internet awareness and lower the barriers to the Internet for more than 300,000 people across Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Now, this isn&#39;t just a feel-good story about showing people in the developing world how to use a browser. <strong>This stuff matters.</strong> Opera&#39;s sole business is making browsers that open up the web world-wide, so that people who don&#39;t have access to a $2000 top-of-the-range laptop or the latest smartphone can access it. For many users around the world, a browser is more than a tool to ‘browse the web’. Sometimes it&#39;s a school when you can afford none, sometimes it&#39;s the only line to an outside world shut off by an oppressive regime.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://thewebindex.org/">Web Index</a> (the World Wide Web Foundation&#39;s measure of the web’s use, utility and impact on people and nations), ranked Bangladesh in the bottom 10 countries measured. The <a href="http://thewebindex.org/2012/09/2012-Web-Index-Key-Findings.pdf">full report [PDF]</a> says &quot;low-ranking countries suffer from a vicious cycle of poor
infrastructure and high costs of access&quot;.</p>
<p>Comparison between Indian states shows that a <a href="http://www.icrier.org/pdf/public_policy19jan09.pdf">10% increase in mobile phone penetration rate leads to a 1.2% increase in GDP [PDF]</a>. Similarly, access to the web increases wealth. A May 2011 report by the McKinsey Global Institute called <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/internet_matters">Internet matters: The Net&#39;s sweeping impact on growth, jobs, and prosperity</a> reveals:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Internet contributes 3.4 percent to GDP averaged over the 13 countries covered by the report (21% of GDP growth for the most developed countries)</li>
<li>Most of the economic value created by the Internet falls outside of the technology sector, with 75 percent of the benefits captured by companies in more traditional industries</li>
<li>The Internet creates 2.6 jobs for each lost to technology-related efficiencies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The web makes a real, quantifiable improvement to people&#39;s lives, and that&#39;s why Opera exists.</strong></p>

<p>And there is a feelgood aspect to the story: the winner of the Bangladesh i-Gen contest, Chowdhury Sadid Alam, won a scholarship and a laptop from the Bangladeshi government, and a trip to Norway where <a href="http://telenor.com/news-and-media/articles/2012/game-on-mobile-browsing-gets-competitive-in-i-gen/">this week</a> he beat Telenor&#39;s EVP of Digital Services, Opera CEO Lars Boilesen, Telenor employees and local students in a battle of speed and agility on the mobile Web. Congratulations!</p>
