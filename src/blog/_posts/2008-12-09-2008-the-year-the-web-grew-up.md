<p><p>In his first regular ZDNet article, our very own Mr Bruce Lawson looks at how web standards have been evolving in the last couple of years, and asks &quot;<a href="http://resources.zdnet.co.uk/articles/comment/0,1000002985,39574452,00.htm?r=4" rel="nofollow">is 2008 the year the Web finally grew up?</a>&quot;. ... </p></p><!--more--><p>This sounds like a bold claim, but I think my partner in crime has some wise word here. We are sitting at the tail end of the year that we saw the first official W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/">working draft of HTML 5</a>, AND the first official W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-roadmap/">working draft of WAI-ARIA</a>, extensions to HTML that allow us to create web applications in a responsible, accessible way.</p>

<p>This last release is in complete contrast to (imo) what happened with the &quot;Web 2.0/Ajax&quot; craze. Sure, we definitely saw a great deal of evolution here in terms of user experience, but in a lot of cases accessibility took a back seat. It took a while for web applications to grow up, but we&#39;re getting there. It looks like in the modern day, we finally have a fleeting glimpse of web technologies (and browser support for them) catching up to what developers are trying to do with them.</p>

<p>The big <em>IF</em> here is whether we can drive the adoption of these standards (I should also add CSS 3 and SVG to the list of standards started above) amongst developers and designers, which will in turn lead to all browsers supporting them, and the circle of evolution being completed.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t just take my word for it - <a href="http://resources.zdnet.co.uk/articles/comment/0,1000002985,39574452,00.htm?r=4">read Bruce&#39;s column</a>!</p>
