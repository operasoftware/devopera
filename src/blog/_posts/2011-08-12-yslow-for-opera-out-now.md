<span class='imgright'><img alt='' src='/blog/yslow-for-opera-out-now/YSlow-for-Opera.png' /></span> For a long time, <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" target="_blank">YSlow</a> has been popular as an effective tool for measuring website performance and highlighting areas for improvement. Previously not available to Opera users, we&#39;re pleased to say that all changes as of this week. We&#39;ve worked with Marcel Duran from the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Exceptional Performance</a> team to create <a href="https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/yslow/" target="_blank">YSlow as an Opera extension</a>.<br/><br/>It all started back in June, when a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/posts/2011/06/yslowmobile/" target="_blank">mobile version of YSlow</a> was released in the form of a bookmarklet. As you probably know, a bookmarklet is simply a chunk of JavaScript code that is executed from within a browser&#39;s address bar or bookmark link. This makes it relatively straightforward to convert YSlow, or indeed most bookmarklets, into an Opera extension. The main change is the addition of a toolbar button and a config.xml settings file.<br/><br/>Next steps? Here&#39;s how to use it right now to see how your website could be made faster.<br/><br/><ol><li>Using <a href="https://www.opera.com/browser/" target="_blank">Opera for desktop</a>, install the extension from the <br/><a href="https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/yslow/" target="_blank">Opera extensions sites</a>.</li><li>Visit the website you&#39;d like to measure the performance of.</li><li>Click the YSlow icon in your toolbar, then click the &quot;Run Test&quot; button.</li></ol><br/>For more details on how to implement some of the resulting suggestions, please head to the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/" target="_blank">YSlow website</a>.
