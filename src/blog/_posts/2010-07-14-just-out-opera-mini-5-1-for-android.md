<p>I&#39;m happy to announce that we&#39;ve just released Opera Mini 5.1 final for Android (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJTaKch7OIU">video</a>). That&#39;s right, we&#39;ve skipped the final for 5, and jumped straight to 5.1, bringing it in line with last week&#39;s <a href="https://www.opera.com/press/releases/2010/07/08/">Opera Mini update</a>.</p>

<p>So, what&#39;s new? Opera Mini for Android now supports 96 languages in the UI, and can be set as the default browser on the device. You&#39;ll also notice better page layout and font rendering on the more high-end Android devices, as well as improved kinetic scrolling.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth pointing out that on high-resolution screens, text (incl. <abbr title="Chinese-Japanese-Korean">CJK</abbr> fonts) loaded in Opera Mini 5.1 for Android is already readable without zooming in, which is handy for skimming page content and titles.</p>

<p>To get Opera Mini 5.1 on your Android phone, simply visit <a href="http://m.opera.com/">m.opera.com</a> or search for it in the Android Market.</p>
