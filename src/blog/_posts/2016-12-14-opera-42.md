Opera 42 (based on Chromium 55) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/) blog. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## Built-in currency converter

Opera is now the first of the major browsers to add a built-in currency converter.

The user select the price they want to convert on the page and Opera will automatically show it in their local currency. Opera 42 supports conversion in 32 currencies based on daily values from the European Central Bank.

Currency symbols are supported, but for ambiguous symbols (e.g. "$", "kr") we recommend using the [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) alphabetic code before or after the amount, as selectable text. This makes it unambiguous for Opera's currency converter what to convert from, but it should also be helpful for end users and other tools in general.

	<p>USD 50</p>
	<p>995 SEK</p>

## Input handling improvements

The [`PointerEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PointerEvent) standard is now supported. It gives developers a unified API for handling "pointer" user input, whether that is mouse, touch, pen, etc. `PointerEvent` also does not block scrolling, which should reduce jank during scrolling. When using `TouchEvent`, the same performance benefit can be achieved using [passive event listeners](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/passive-event-listeners). The [`touch-action`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/pointer-events#default_actions) CSS property is now also supported, to allow reacting to gestures such as panning. For more information, see [Pointing the Way Forward](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/pointer-events) by Sérgio Gomes.

The [`auxclick`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/auxclick) event is now fired for non-primary mouse buttons, instead of `click`.

## JavaScript `async` and `await`

The `async` and `await` keywords are now supported, which allows writing Promise-based JavaScript with a neater syntax, and enables use of `try`/`catch` to catch rejected promises.

	async function myFirstAsyncFunction() {
		try {
			const fulfilledValue = await promise;
		}
		catch (rejectedValue) {
			// …
		}
	}

For more information, see [Async functions - making promises friendly](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/async-functions) by Jake Archibald.

## CSS automatic hyphenation

The [`hyphens`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens) CSS property is now supported (on Mac), which can be used to enable automatic hyphenation when text broken across lines. Possible values are `none`, `manual` (initial value) and `auto`.

For `none`, hyphenation will not happen even when `&shy;` is used. For `manual`, hyphenation only happens for `&shy;`. For `auto`, automatic hyphenation happens, based on the language specified in the `lang` attribute.

	html { hyphens: auto; }
	code { hyphens: manual; }

See [demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/css-hyphens/).

## `once` event listener option

The [`once` event listener option`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-addeventlisteneroptions-once) is now supported, for a convenient way to only invoke an event listener once and then remove the listener.

	element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
		// ...one-time handling of the click event...
	}, {once: true});

For more information, see [Once Upon an Event Listener](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/addeventlistener-once) by Jeff Posnick.

## Persistent storage

[Persistent storage](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/persistent-storage) is now on by default.

## TLS

* The TLS stack now implements [GREASE](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-davidben-tls-grease-00.html), a mechanism to help prevent problems with buggy TLS servers.
* RSA-PSS signature algorithms have been added to TLS to prepare for [TLS 1.3](https://tlswg.github.io/tls13-spec/).

## New constructors

`new MediaStreamTrackEvent(type, options)` and `new AudioNode(context, options)` constructors are now available.

## `document.write()` intervention

Cross-origin and parser-blocking scripts injected using `document.write()` will no longer load over 2G connections. See [this article](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/08/removing-document-write) by Paul Kinlan for more information.

## Deprecated and removed features

* As mentioned above, the `click` event is no longer fired for non-primary mouse buttons. In most cases this is desirable; `click` event handlers are most often intended to handle primary clicks. But if you need to handle non-primary clicks (e.g., middle mouse button), the `auxclick` event can be used. The `contextmenu` event can also be used to handle clicks that would open a context menu (typically right-click).
* `BaseAudioContext` will replace `AudioContext` in the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
* CSS Clipping Path properties no longer require the `webkit` prefix.
* The `MediaStream` constructor is now available without prefix alongside the existing `webkitMediaStream`.
* Non-script MIME types for external scripts (e.g., `<script src="foo" type="something/something">`) is deprecated and will from M56 (Opera 43) no longer be pre-fetched. This typically results in less wasted fetches. `<script data-src="foo" type="something/something">` is recommended instead.
* `<textarea maxlength="">` and `<textarea minlength="">` have been updated to count each line break as one character, instead of two.
* The `webkit` prefix has been removed from the `imageSmoothingEnabled` property of `CanvasRenderingContext2D`.
