Opera 51 (based on Chromium 64) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To
find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop blog post](https://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2018/02/opera-51/).
Here’s what it means for web developers.


## Mitigations for the *"Spectre"* vulnerability

In order to [mitigate](http://blogs.opera.com/security/2018/01/opera-mitigates-critical-cpu-vulnerabilities/) the
recently disclosed security vulnerability called *"Spectre"*, the following restrictions that affect the functionality
of the web platform have been applied:

* The `SharedArrayBuffer` functionality has been removed.
* The resolution of `performance.now()` has been clamped to 100μs.

Both of the above serve to reduce the possibility of performing a side-channel attack to read sensitive user data, by
removing potential ways to acquire a high-precision timing source.

## Resize Observer

Responsive web applications are often written using CSS media queries or `window.onresize` to build components that
adapt to different viewport sizes. Both of these are global signals, thus requiring the overall viewport to change in
order for the site to respond accordingly. With the [Resize Observer](https://wicg.github.io/ResizeObserver/) API, web
applications can [observe changes](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/resizeobserver/) to sizes of elements on a
page with [finer granularity](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/10/resizeobserver).

The following code snippet uses the Resize Observer API to observe size changes to an element:

      const ro = new ResizeObserver((entries) => {
        for (const entry of entries) {
          const cr = entry.contentRect;
          console.log('Element: ', entry.target);
          console.log(`Element size: ${cr.width}px × ${cr.height}px`);
          console.log(`Element padding: ${cr.top}px / ${cr.left}px`);
        }
      });

      // Observe one or multiple elements
      ro.observe(someElement);


## `import.meta`

Developers writing JavaScript modules often want access to host-specific metadata about the
current module. To make this easier, support for the [`import.meta`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-meta) property has been added. This property currently exposes the module URL as `import.meta.url`. Authors of libraries may want to
access the URL of the module being bundled into the library to more easily resolve resources
relative to the module file as opposed to the current HTML document.


## Other features in this release

### Blink > Animation

* The [`offset-path`](https://drafts.fxtf.org/motion-1/#offset-path-property) property can now be
  [animated](http://codepen.io/ericwilligers/pen/PpqMqM), allowing for even more creative ways to move an element
  around.

### Blink > Fonts

* The [`text-decoration-skip-ink`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-decor-4/#text-decoration-skip-ink-property) CSS
  property has been added, [allowing](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/GOadjL) developers better control over how underline
  and overline decorations are [drawn](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lBI4_IqfEcZ2hvlJ1-3JSw8yxoLC0vGg/view?usp=sharing)
  when they cross over a glyph.

### Blink > Input

* Coordinates of a `PointerEvent` with [`pointerType === "mouse"`](https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#extensions-to-the-mouseevent-interface)
  are now [fractional](https://output.jsbin.com/quqoqe/4/quiet), resulting in more precise mouse measurements.

### Blink > JavaScript

* Support for [named captures in regular expressions](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-named-groups) has been
  added, [allowing](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/07/upcoming-regexp-features#named_captures)
  developers to assign meaningful names to portions of a string that a regular expression matches.
* Support for [Unicode property escapes](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/07/upcoming-regexp-features#unicode_property_escapes) `\p{…}`
  and `\P{…}` for regular expressions that have the '`u`' flag set has been added, allowing developers to create more
  powerful Unicode-aware regular expressions.
* [`Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.formatToParts()`](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-formatToParts) has been added to
  assist with local-aware formatting of strings produced by internationalization formatters.

### Blink > Media

* The [default `preload` value](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/chrome-63-64-media-updates#media-preload-defaults-metadata)
  for `<video>` and `<audio>` elements has been changed to `metadata` in order to reduce bandwidth and resource usage,
  by only loading resource metadata and not the media resource itself. This aligns Opera with other browser
  implementations.
* A `"NotSupportedError"` `DOMException` is now thrown [when](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/media/playback-rate-exception)
  a media element&#8217;s [playbackRate](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#dom-media-playbackrate) is set to a value
  that is [not supported](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/chrome-63-64-media-updates#unsupported-playbackRate-raises-exception)
  by Opera, like a negative value.
* [`getUserMedia()`](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia()) now returns a rejected
  Promise with a `DOMException` or `OverconstrainedError` when there is an error.

### Blink > Network

* The [cache mode](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-cache-mode) of a `Request` can now be specified using
  the [`cache`](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-request-cache) option and accessed using
  [`Request.prototype.cache`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Request/cache). For reload requests, the
  `"reload"` value is now also exposed through said property.

### Blink > Permissions API

* The [Permissions API](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/) can now query the status of the
  [`camera`](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#dom-permissionname-camera) and
  [`microphone`](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#dom-permissionname-camera) permissions.

### Blink > Scroll

* [`HTMLElement.prototype.focus`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#dom-focus), accepts the
  `preventScroll` option, to allow focusing an element without scrolling to it.

### Blink > SVG

* Support for the [`transform-box`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-box) CSS property has
  been added. This allow developers better control over what percentages are resolved against in the
  [`transform`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#transform-property) and
  [`transform-origin`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-transforms/#transform-property) properties on SVG elements.

### Blink > WebAudio

* [`AudioWorklet`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioWorklet), an API that
  [exposes](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/web-audio-samples/audio-worklet/) low-level audio processing capability
  to support custom AudioNodes, is now available behind the experimental flag.

### Blink > WebRTC

* The [`RTCPeerConnection` interface](https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#interface-definition) now supports `addTrack()`
  for single stream use cases, as well as `removeTrack()`, `getSenders()` and `ontrack`. A minimal version of the
  `RTCRtpSender` interface is now also supported.

### Blink > Window APIs

* `window.alert()` [no longer](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/5ia5klTZjwA/9a1ncgkbBQAJ)
  brings a backgrounded tab to the foreground but instead shows the alert when the user switches to the background tab.


## Deprecations and interoperability improvements

### Blink > CSS

* The non-standard
  [`getMatchedCSSRules`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkitjs/domwindow/1631923-getmatchedcssrules) has
  been [removed](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/fd-QLCiLESQ/_mfowSsRR8oJ). Developers
  can use the [Blink polyfill](https://gist.github.com/darrnshn/addeabe2575177342cc6242e20ecadbd) instead.

### Blink > DOM

* An `Element` can no longer host more than one [Shadow Root](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/). This
  behavior has been [deprecated](https://www.w3.org/wiki/Webapps/WebComponentsApril2015Meeting) since Opera 32.

### Blink > Performance APIs

* To encourage adoption of standardized loading metrics API such as [Navigation Timing 2](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5409443269312512),
  [`nextHopProtocol`](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5650461096935424) and [Paint Timing API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/07/nic60#paint),
  the non-standardized `chrome.loadTimes` API is being [deprecated](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/chrome-loadtimes-deprecated).
