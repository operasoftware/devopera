<h3>Fastest Browser</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera 10.51 final for Windows is out now </a> and is truly the fastest browser on earth.
</p>
<p>
Opera 10.50 has already proven to provide users with a super-quick experience. Based on Peacekeeper&#39;s benchmark results, <a href="http://service.futuremark.com/peacekeeper/results.action?key=2tLP">Opera 10.51 for Windows takes the clear lead with a 27% increase in speed</a> from our most recent version.

<p>
In this release, we have pushed to get as many fixes into 10.51, largely due to the terrific community feedback provided on 10.50. Thank you for your participation! If you&#39;d like more details on exactly what we&#39;ve done, see the <a href="https://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/1051/">Opera 10.51 Windows release change logs</a>

For the curious minds, the machine specification that hit the highest benchmark score across all tested browsers is shown below.

<h3>Most compliant JavaScript</h3>
<p>Apart from bug fixes, we have also done numerous improvements to the Carakan JavaScript engine.</p>
<p>
Sputnik - a new JavaScript conformance test suite produced by Google Labs, shows that <a href="http://sputnik.googlelabs.com/compare">Opera passes more tests that adhere to the ECMA-262 specification</a> than other browsers compared.
