Opera 47 (based on Chromium 60) for [Mac, Windows, Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To
find out what’s new for users, see our
[Desktop blog post](http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2017/08/exportable-bookmarks-smoother-videos-design-improvements-opera-47/).
Here’s what it means for web developers.

## Paint Timing API

While no generalized metric perfectly captures when a page is [loaded](https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing)
in all cases, [First Paint and First Contentful Paint](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/user-centric-performance-metrics#first_paint_and_fist_contentful_paint) are invaluable numbers to measure critical user moments during
loading. To give developers [better insight](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/user-centric-performance-metrics)
into their site&#8217;s loading performance, the new [Paint Timing API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ljq-Jn-EgU)
exposes metrics that capture First Paint and First Contentful Paint.

## CSS `font-display`

Downloadable web fonts are often used to create more visually rich web experiences. Historically,
Opera has delayed rendering text until the specified font is available, to ensure visual
correctness. However, downloading a font can take as long as several seconds on a poor connection,
significantly delaying the time until a user sees content. Opera now supports the CSS [`font-display`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face/font-display)
[property](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/02/font-display) as part of an [`@font-face`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) descriptor, allowing developers to specify how and when Opera [displays text content](http://output.jsbin.com/nigahi/latest/quiet) while downloading fonts.

## Credential Management API improvements

Starting in Opera 47, `PasswordCredential` will also contain the user&#8217;s password, alleviating
the need for a custom `fetch()` to access a stored password.

[Some changes](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/credential-management-updates) has also been made to
to better align with the work being done in the [Web Authentication Working Group](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn).
This includes the deprecation of `requireUserMediation`, which has been renamed to `preventSilentAccess`.

## Other features in this release

* [Object rest & spread properties](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/object-rest-spread) are now supported, making it simpler to merge and shallow-clone objects and implement various immutable object patterns.
* The new [Web Push Encryption](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-webpush-encryption-08) format is now supported and [`PushManager.supportedContentEncodings`](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#dom-pushmanager-supportedcontentencodings) can be used to detect where it can be used.
* [`PushSubscription.expirationTime`](https://w3c.github.io/push-api/#dom-pushsubscription-expirationtime) is now available, notifying sites when and if a subscription will expire.
* To improve performance and predictability, [`pointermove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/pointermove) and [`mousemove`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mousemove) events are now delivered once per animation frame (analog to `requestAnimationFrame`), matching the current functionality of [scroll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/scroll) and [`TouchEvents`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent).
* The `:focus-within` CSS pseudo-class is now available, [affecting](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/xOLJym) [any](https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/files/2017/05/focus-within-menu.html) [element](https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/files/2017/05/focus-within-demo.html) the `:focus` pseudo-class affects, as well as any element with a descendant affected by `:focus`.
* The CSS [`frames()` timing function](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-timing-1/#frames-timing-functions) is now available, [allowing for proper frame-based animations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dxY0VLynyZzPr-KSOf7eIedhC-fjGaR2NTfWMZDjSTc/edit#). (Animations where all frames have exactly the same duration, including its first and last frames.)
* To provide an improved way to capture editing actions, [`InputEvent`](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/WD-input-events-1-20170321/) now allows user input to be managed by script, enhancing the details provided to editable elements.
* To increase security, a `beforeunload` dialog triggered when the user leaves a site will now only be shown if the frame attempting to display it has ever received a user gesture or user interaction, though the [`beforeunload` event](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#unloading-documents) will still be dispatched regardless.
* VP9, an open and royalty-free video coding format, can now be [used](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/media/test/data/bear-320x240-v_frag-vp9.mp4) with the [MP4 (ISO BMFF) container](http://www.webmproject.org/vp9/mp4/) and requires the new VP9 string format mentioned below.
* A new [VP9 string format](http://www.webmproject.org/vp9/mp4/#codecs-parameter-string) is now available and accepted by various [media-related APIs](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/media/vp9-codec-string.html), enabling developers to describe the encoding properties that are common in video codecs, but are not yet exposed.

## Deprecations and interoperability improvements

* `getElementsByTagName()` now accepts qualified names in response to an update to the [DOM specification](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-getelementsbytagname).
* The [`/deep/` combinator](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-css-scoping-1-20140403/#deep-combinator) which has been removed from the [current specification](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scoping/), now behaves like the [descendant combinator](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#descendant-combinator), which is effectively a no-op. Previously it would enable selecting descendants in shadow trees.
* To [improve the user experience](https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/47), calls to [`Navigator.vibrate()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/vibrate) now immediately return `false` if the user hasn't explicitly tapped on the frame or any embedded frame, matching existing behavior for cross-origin `iframes`.
* `WEBKIT_KEYFRAME_RULE` and `WEBKIT_KEYFRAMES_RULE` have been removed in favor of the unprefixed standardized APIs, [`KEYFRAME_RULE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSKeyframeRule) and [`KEYFRAMES_RULE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSKeyframesRule).
* Support for non-standard `WebKitAnimationEvent` and `WebKitTransitionEvent` has been removed from [`document.createEvent()`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-createevent).
* To better align with [spec](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#legacy-callback-interface-object), `NodeIterator.filter` and `TreeWalker.filter` no longer wrap JavaScript objects, and `.prototype` has been removed from `window.NodeFilter`.
* [`RTCPeerConnection.getStreamById()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection/getStreamById) is being removed, and a [polyfill](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=698163#c10) is recommended as a replacement.
* `SVGPathElement.getPathSegAtLength()` has been deprecated, and will removed in Opera 49 (Chromium 62), since it has been been removed from the [SVGPathElement interface](https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/paths.html#InterfaceSVGPathElement) in the SVG2 spec.
* `Headers.prototype.getAll()` has been removed from the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) in line with its removal from the spec.
