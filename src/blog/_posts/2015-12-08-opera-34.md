Opera 34 (based on Chromium 47) for [Mac, Windows, and Linux](http://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what’s new for users, see our [Desktop](http://blogs.opera.com/desktop/2015/12/opera-34-technology-help/) and [Mobile](http://www.opera.com/blogs/mobile/2015/12/force-enable-zoom-opera-34-for-android/) blogs. Here’s what it means for web developers.

## `Array.prototype.includes`

ES2016 (previously known as “ES7”) features [a new array method named `includes`](https://tc39.github.io/Array.prototype.includes/) that determines whether an array includes a given element.

	// Good ol’ ES5:
	var isIncluded = someArray.indexOf(element) != -1;
	// Shiny new ES2016:
	const isIncluded = someArray.includes(element);

Compared to the old-school `indexOf` approach, `includes` handles `NaN` more elegantly:

	var array = [NaN];
	array.indexOf(NaN) != -1;
	// → false
	array.includes(NaN);
	// → true

`includes` is also available for [typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays#Typed_array_views) such as `Int16Array` or `Float64Array`.

## ES6 rest parameters

The [ES6 rest parameters syntax](https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-function-definitions) allows functions to have a variable number of arguments without using the `arguments` object. Unlike `arguments`, the rest argument is a proper array, meaning array methods can be called on it directly:

	// ES5:
	function sort() {
		var sortedArgs = [].sort.call(arguments);
		return sortedArgs;
	}

	sort('z', 'y', 'x', 'a', 'c', 'b');
	// → 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z'

	// ES6:
	function sort(...args) {
		var sortedArgs = args.sort();
		return sortedArgs;
	}

	sort('z', 'y', 'x', 'a', 'c', 'b');
	// → 'a', 'b', 'c', 'x', 'y', 'z'

## `navigator.mediaDevices`

The new `navigator.mediaDevices` API can be used to enumerate connected media devices and to retrieve their media streams. We recommend the following:

* Use `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` instead of the non-standard  `MediaStreamTrack.getSources()` which doesn’t support audio output devices.
* Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` instead of `navigator.getUserMedia()`.

More info can be found [on the Google Developers blog](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/10/media-devices), and hey — [here’s a demo](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/devices/input-output/).

## `MouseEvent.prototype.getModifierState`

We now support [the `getModifierState` method on `MouseEvent` instances](https://w3c.github.io/uievents/#widl-MouseEvent-getModifierState). It returns information about which modifier keys were pressed at the time the event was fired. Previously, this method was only available on `KeyboardEvent` instances. This change matches the spec and makes these APIs more consistent. [A demo is available.](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/mouseevent-get-modifier-state/)

## `requestIdleCallback`

[The new `requestIdleCallback` API](https://w3c.github.io/requestidlecallback/) allows scheduling a task to run when the browser is idle. This makes it possible to perform background work on the main event loop, without impacting latency-critical events such as animation and input response.

For more information, check out [the excellent tutorial on the Google Developers blog](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/08/using-requestidlecallback).

## `InputDeviceCapabilities`

[The new `InputDeviceCapabilities` API](https://rbyers.github.io/InputDevice/) provides details about the physical device responsible for generating an event. `InputDeviceCapabilities.prototype.firesTouchEvents` returns whether this device dispatches touch events. All types of `UIEvent` now have their own `sourceCapabilities` property which returns the `InputDeviceCapabilities` associated with the physical device responsible for them.

## Fetch API: `RequestInit.referrer`

[This feature](https://github.com/google/Chrome.Docs/blob/master/m47/Request_Constructor_Additions.md) allows requests captured by service workers to match the original referrer.

By default, a captured request gets the service worker’s referrer (i.e. the service worker’s script URL), but with this feature the request keeps the original referrer.

## Updated default Fetch API request flags for service workers

The flags of request objects that are passed to the service worker’s Fetch Event handler for navigation requests have been changed. Previously, these were the defaults for `mode`, `credentials`, and `redirect`:

	{
		'mode': 'no-cors',
		'credentials': 'same-origin'
		'redirect': 'follow'
	}

The new defaults (matching the spec) are:

	{
		'mode': 'same-origin',
		'credentials': 'include'
		'redirect': 'manual'
	}

## Cache API: `matchAll`

[`Cache.prototype.matchAll`](https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#cache-matchall) is now supported. It greatly simplifies bulk searching of the cache, and [allows you to get multiple matches](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/09/updates-to-cache-api#cachematchall-coming-to-chrome-47).

## Removed features

[The SVG 1.1 `hasExtension()` methods](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/types.html#InterfaceSVGTests) on `SVGAnimationElement`, `SVGCursorElement`, `SVGGraphicsElement`, `SVGMaskElement`, and `SVGPatternElement` have been [removed in SVG 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/types.html#InterfaceSVGTests). Now, they’re removed from Opera and Chrome as well. Don’t worry — these methods always returned `false` and were thus of no real use anyway.

The same goes for [a few SVG 1.1 SVG element methods](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#InterfaceSVGSVGElement) — [they no longer exist in SVG 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/struct.html#InterfaceSVGSVGElement). So long, `pixelUnitToMillimeterX`, `pixelUnitToMillimeterY`, `screenPixelToMillimeterX`, and `screenPixelToMillimeterY`, and thanks for all the pixels! (These properties didn’t do what their names suggested in the first place — all they did was return the constant `0.2645833194255829`.)

## Improved text selection

Chromium no longer highlights the gaps between content when painting selections.

<figure block="figure">
	<img elem="media" src="{{ page.id }}/selection.png" width="388" alt="">
	<figcaption elem="caption">The new, much cleaner, text selection behavior. <a href="{{ page.id }}/selection.jpg">A before/after comparison is available, too.</a></figcaption>
</figure>

## More extension APIs

Opera 34 adds support for [the `chrome.desktopCapture` API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/desktopCapture), enabling extensions with screensharing capabilities.

## What’s next?
