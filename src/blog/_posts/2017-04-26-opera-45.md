Opera 45 (based on Chromium 58) for [Mac, Windows,
Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what's new
for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/)
blog. Here's what it means for web developers.

## IndexedDB 2.0

[IndexedDB 2.0](http://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) is now supported in
Opera, making it simpler to work with large data sets in the
browser. IDB 2.0 features new schema management, bulk action methods,
and more standardized handling of failures.

The structure of a site's database has large performance impacts and
can be difficult to change. To simplify updates, [object
stores](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#dom-idbobjectstore-name) and
[indexes](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#index-construct) can now be
renamed in-place after a refactoring. Sites can also use more natural
keys without worrying about a performance penalty thanks to [binary
keys](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/#key-construct), which allow
compact representations for custom keys.

For more information about what IndexedDB 2.0 brings, check out
[Bevis Tseng's
summary](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/10/whats-new-in-indexeddb-2-0/).

## An improvement to iframe navigation

Third-party content, such as advertising, that automatically redirects
the page can annoy users and create security issues. Because of this,
developers are able to put third-party content inside sandboxed
`iframes` to prevent this behavior. However, in some cases this type of
content needs to navigate the top-level page when clicked, like a
standard advertisement.

To address this, Opera 45 now supports the new `iframe` sandbox
keyword
[allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#attr-iframe-sandbox-allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation). This
keyword gives sandboxed `iframes` the ability to navigate the
top-level page when triggered by user interaction, while still
blocking auto-redirects.


## Selection API changes

* Using
  [`removeRange()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection/removeRange),
  a new function, developers can now programmatically remove a
  specified text Range.

* When accessing properties like `selectionDirection`,
  `selectionStart`, and `selectionEnd`, Opera will now return `null`
  when it would have thrown an `InvalidStateError DOMException`.

* Rather than silently clamping offset values that were too large,
  `setBaseAndExtent()` now throws an `IndexSizeError DOMException` to
  better align with spec.

* Rather than silently failing for `DocumentType` node inputs,
  `setBaseAndExtent()`, `extend()`, and `collapse()` now throw
  `InvalidNodeTypeError DOMException` to better align with spec.

* To improve interoperability, `Selection.addRange()` now ignores an
  additional range if it overlaps with an existing range, rather than
  merging the two ranges.

* To better align with spec, `getRangeAt()` now always returns a new
  `Range` with position normalization.


## Other features in this release

* Opera adds in-form warnings for sensitive fields when the top-level
  page is not HTTPS. Whenever you start filling in your password or
  credit card number on a page, which is not HTTPS, the warning will
  appear.

* [`Workers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker)
  and
  [`SharedWorkers`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker)
  can now be created using
  [`data:`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs)
  URLs.  Note that such workers will have an [opaque
  origin](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin-opaque).

* [`PointerEvents.getCoalescedEvents()`](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/extension.html)
  allows developers to access all input events since the last time a
  `PointerEvent` was delivered, making it easier for drawing apps to
  create smoother curves using a precise history of points.

* Developers can now customize Opera's native media controls such as
  the `download`, `fullscreen` and `remoteplayback` buttons using the
  new [ControlsList
  API](https://github.com/WICG/controls-list/blob/gh-pages/explainer.md).

* Sites can now
  [access](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/media/color-gamut-media-query.html)
  the approximate range of colors supported by Opera and output
  devices using the `color-gamut` Media Query.

* [`display:
  flow-root`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-display-3/#valdef-display-flow-root)
  is now supported.  An effect of flow-root is that it envelops
  floats, and can be used as a [replacement for the clearfix
  hack](https://codepen.io/rachelandrew/pen/RKgevX).

* To improve JavaScript parsing time, `SVGPoint`, `SVGRect`, and
  `SVGMatrix` have been transferred to [new
  interfaces](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/03/introducing-the-getboxquads-api/)
  outside of [Geometry](https://www.w3.org/TR/geometry-1/).

* The
  [`PointerEvent.tangentialPressure`](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#dom-pointerevent-tangentialpressure)
  and
  [PointerEvent.twist](https://w3c.github.io/pointerevents/#dom-pointerevent-twist)
  attributes are now supported on Opera for Mac to provide more
  information to stylus devices and painting apps.

* To simplify developer experience, trailing commas are now
  [allowed](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-trailing-function-commas)
  in JavaScript for formal parameter and argument lists.

* The WebAudio API's new playback
  [`AudioContextLatencyCategory`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#BaseAudioContext)
  enables the developer to easily make conscious tradeoffs between
  latency, power, and CPU efficiency.

## Deprecated and removed features

* `Apple-interchange-newline`, `Apple-converted-space`,
  `Apple-paste-as-quotation`, `Apple-style-span`, and `Apple-tab-span`
  have been deprecated as they are non-standard CSS classes.

* `usemap` attributes now use case-sensitive matching rather than
  [compatibility
  caseless](https://w3c.github.io/html/infrastructure.html#compatibility-caseless)
  to better align with spec.

* Sites must now use HTTPS when requesting notification permissions or
  creating non-persistent local notifications with the [Notifications
  API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API),
  in accordance with Chromium's
  [policy](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins)
  around powerful features.

* Encrypted Media Extensions transmitted over non-secure origins has
  been deprecated per Chromium's
  [policy](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security/deprecating-powerful-features-on-insecure-origins)
  around powerful features and in compliance with the spec.

* To better align with spec,
  [`cancelBubble`](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-event-cancelbubble)
  is now considered an alias to `stopPropagation()` when set to true,
  and does not do anything when set to false.

* The
  [`VTTRegion`](https://w3c.github.io/webvtt/#the-vttregion-interface)
  interface functions, `addRegion()` and `removeRegion()`, have been
  removed from the WebVTT spec and are therefore being removed from
  Opera.

* Top-level navigations to `data:` URLs have been deprecated to further
  protect users from spoofing and phishing attempts.

* An instance of `HTMLEmbedElement` or `HTMLObjectElement` can no
  longer be called as a function, since the legacy caller has been
  removed.

* Pre-standard ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphers have been removed following
  the standardization of these algorithms at the IETF as [RFC
  7539](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539) and [RFC
  7905](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7905), and the subsequent
  shipping of the standard versions in Opera 28.

* The
  [AudioBuffer](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#AudioBuffer)
  constructor now accepts the `sampleRate` member of an
  `AudioBufferOptions` dictionary instead of a `context` argument,
  simplifying the interface and emphasizing that `AudioBuffers` can be
  shared between `AudioContexts`.

* The synchronous
  [`FileReaderSync`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReaderSync)
  API has been deprecated in service workers, as the service worker
  spec requires all types of synchronous requests to be initiated
  outside of a service worker.

* The
  [abbr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/abbr)
  and
  [acronym](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/acronym)
  elements now have a dotted underline by default to align with the
  HTML standard.

* The `motion-path`, `motion-offset`, and `motion-rotation` CSS
  properties have been removed in favor of the new versions:
  `offset-path`, `offset-distance`, `offset-rotate`.

* The `AudioSourceNode` interface has been removed as it was not part
  of the WebAudio spec.

* The `webkitdropzone` attribute has been removed as it was not widely
  adopted.
