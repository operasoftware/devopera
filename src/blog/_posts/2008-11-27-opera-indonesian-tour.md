<p>After 8 days, <a href="http://my.opera.com/universitytours/blog/index.dml/tag/indonesia">11 universities</a> and 9 kilograms of Nasi Goreng per person, the first Opera university tour of Indonesia is finished.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="{{ page.id }}/indonesia-Bruce.pdf">Bruce&#39;s slides: Web Standards for the Future, (PDF 550K)</a>. Note that I was tweaking and changing the slides depending on the University&#39;s focus, so here&#39;s the &quot;full&quot; version that includes everything. No university got all of these. The format is accessible <abbr>PDF</abbr> to make it small, as I&#39;ve experienced Indonesian bandwidth speeds..! If you need another format, drop me a line. You&#39;re welcome to share these with your friends or classmates - I hope they make sense. If notâ€¦well, you&#39;ll have to invite me back again!</p>

<p>The <a href="/blog/uk-university-tour-web-standards-for-the-future/opera-uk-tour.zip">HTML demos</a> are available, but you&#39;ll need a <a href="http://labs.opera.com/downloads/">special video build of Opera</a> to watch the videos.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the cool <code>canvas</code> demonstration I talked about: <a href="http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/04/super-mario-in-14kb-javascript.html">Super Mario in 14kB Javascript</a>.</p>

<p><a href="{{ page.id }}/Indonesia%20Tour%20presentation-zibincheah.pdf">Zibin&#39;s slides: Web Browser Industry (PDF 1M)</a>. This presentation is about the mobile web industry -trends today and tomorrow. I&#39;ve also presented Opera&#39;s four main products. The slide about top ten sites transcoded by Opera Mini in Indonesia was the showstopper. Audience giggled upon finding out that friendster bandwidth was more than the 2nd to 10th spot combined.</p>

<p>To celebrate the success of the Indonesian tour, we&#39;ve published a new State of the Mobile Web report focussing on <a href="https://www.opera.com/smw/2008/10/">South-East Asian mobile browsing</a>. Bad news for any web site that doesn&#39;t follow Web Standards, with data like this:</p>
<ul><li>Indonesia and Malaysia lead the way for mobile Web adoption, followed by Thailand and Brunei.
Indonesia leads the top 9 countries in page views, with each user browsing 358 pages on average in October 2008, well above the global average.</li>
<li>Growth rates are soaring: Malaysia leads the top 9 with 462.6% growth in users this year, followed by the Philippines (396.4% growth) and Indonesia (329.5% growth).</li>
<li>Friendster is the premier social-networking site in the region, with hi5 coming in second.
Nokia is dominant in the region, with brands like Sony Ericsson and Huawei competing for a distant second place.</li>
</ul>
