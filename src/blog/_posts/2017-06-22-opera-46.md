Opera 46 (based on Chromium 59) for [Mac, Windows,
Linux](https://www.opera.com/computer) is out! To find out what's new
for users, see our [Desktop](https://www.opera.com/blogs/desktop/)
blog. Here's what it means for web developers.

## Animated PNG

Opera now supports animated PNG, or APNG for short. APNG is a file format that works similarly to
GIF. The difference is that APNG is smaller and supports both 24-bit images and 8-bit transparency.
It has become quite popular recently, particularly since Apple [adopted the APNG file format for iOS
10 iMessage apps](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/extensions/messaging/).
APNG was also supported in Presto-based Opera 12.

Watch the [APNG demo](http://littlesvr.ca/apng/gif_apng_webp1.html) and
[learn more about this format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APNG).

## SVG favicons

This was actually added in Opera 44, but we missed to write about it!

This might still be a bit rough in the edges, but in general SVG favicons should now work in Opera!
(But [not yet in Chromium](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=294179).)
To see this in action, check some of the [WHATWG standards](https://spec.whatwg.org/) which use SVG
favicons. Firefox [also supports](http://caniuse.com/#feat=link-icon-svg) SVG favicons, and it was
also supported in Presto-based Opera 12.

## Expensive background tab throttling

Opera now throttles expensive background tabs. This reduces the processing power required for
background tabs and improves battery life and browsing performance. Try it out yourself with this
[background timer throttling demo](https://fiddle.jshell.net/vvL0e9x3/show/light/).

## Service worker navigation preload

The [Service Worker](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/) navigation preload API enables the
browser to preload navigation requests while a service worker is starting up. See
[Speed up Service Worker with Navigation Preloads](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/02/navigation-preload)
by Jake Archibald for more information.

## Other features in this release

* Developers can now use [`MediaError`'s `message` property](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#dom-mediaerror-message) to obtain greater detail about a MediaError produced by `<audio>` or `<video>`.
* [`WritableStreams`](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#ws-intro) are now available as part of the [Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/) for processing streams of data, while providing a standard abstraction for writing streaming data to a sink with built-in [backpressure](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#backpressure) and queuing.
* The [Streams API](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/) has been expanded with the ability to pipe between [`ReadableStreams`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/ReadableStream) and [`WritableStreams`](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#ws-intro) via the [`pipeTo()`](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-pipe-to) and [`pipeThrough()`](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/#rs-pipe-through) methods, allowing easier consumption of streaming data.
* The [Image Capture API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/12/imagecapture) now allows sites to take higher resolution images than before, providing full control over camera settings such as zoom, ISO, and white balance.
* To provide enhanced privacy, CSS stylesheets can now specify their own [referrer policy](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/) via the HTTP header, rather than always inheriting the referrer policy of the document that originally referenced it.
* [Touch events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events) are now aligned to [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame), ensuring that input is processed as part of the document lifecycle and creating a more efficient and adaptive input response.
* The new [`worker-src`](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#directive-worker-src) Content Security Policy directive restricts which URLs may be loaded as a [`Worker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker), [`SharedWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker), or [`ServiceWorker`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker).

## Deprecations and interoperability improvements

* The `<dialog>` element has changed from display: inline to block by default to better align with the [spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/rendering.html#flow-content-3).
* Following [removal](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/commit/2078b46218f7462735bb0b5107c9a3e84fb4c4b1) from the [Media Queries](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/) spec, support for `hover: on-demand` and `any-hover: on-demand` media queries have been removed.
* To better align with spec and help avoid race conditions, [`decodeAudioData`](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#widl-BaseAudioContext-decodeAudioData-Promise-AudioBuffer--ArrayBuffer-audioData-DecodeSuccessCallback-successCallback-DecodeErrorCallback-errorCallback) now detaches the given ArrayBuffer before decoding, removing all content from the object and making it unable to be reused or examined.
* The `-internal-media-controls-cast-button` CSS selector has been removed in favor of the [Remote Playback API](https://w3c.github.io/remote-playback/).
* The `-internal-media-controls-text-track-list*` CSS selectors have been removed in favor of custom-built video controls.
* The `SVGTests.requiredFeatures` attribute has been deprecated following its removal from the [spec](https://github.com/w3c/svgwg/commit/9a30d01f6410dc516c5f874d71e957230a3448cd).
* `initDeviceMotionEvent()` and `initDeviceOrientationEvent()` were removed in favor of [`DeviceOrientationEvent()`](http://deviceorientationevent/) and [`DeviceMotionEvent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DeviceMotionEvent), following a spec trend of moving away from initialization functions and toward constructors.
* To preserve consistency across browsers, the `sample` property will now be included in a [violation](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#deprecated-serialize-violation) report (and associated [`SecurityPolicyViolationEvent`](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-csp/#violation-events) object) if a `report-sample` expression is present in the violated directive.
* To increase security, Opera will now block requests for subresources that contain embedded credentials, and instead handle them as network errors.
* To increase security, Opera will now block requests from HTTP/HTTPS documents to ftp: URLs.
* To preserve consistency across browsers, injecting JavaScript via AppleScript is longer supported in Opera for Mac.
* The ability to call `Notification.requestPermission()` from non-main frames has been deprecated to align the requirements for notification permission with requirements for push notifications, and ease friction for developers.
* Support for Shared Dictionary Compression (SDCH) has been [disabled](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/SDCH%7Csort:relevance/blink-dev/nQl0ORHy7sw/HNpR96sqAgAJ) until a stable API has been standardized.
