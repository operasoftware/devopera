## Introduction

At the [Intel Developer Forum][1] in September 2011, Opera unveiled a first demo build of Opera Mobile for Android running on an Intel Oak Trail-powered (Atom Z670) Green Ridge tablet with Ice Cream Sandwich OS installed. This marked the first public viewing of a native Android application running on x86 architecture.
