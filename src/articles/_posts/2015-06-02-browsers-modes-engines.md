The Opera browser is available on a wide range of platforms, in a number of flavors with different modes, engines and levels of standards support. As things can get somewhat confusing — did you know that Opera Mini on iOS comes with three rendering modes, one of which is powered by `UIWebView` & Opera Turbo? — we decided to create a simple product overview that details some of these technical differences.

We’ll keep this table as up-to-date as possible, so be sure to bookmark this page for later reference!

Notes:

- Opera Turbo mode compresses data up to 80%. Opera Mini mode compresses data up to 90%.
- Opera Turbo marked with asterisk also has a [Video Boost](https://www.opera.com/blogs/mobile/2014/11/new-opera-mini-for-iphone-ipad-less-buffering-free-download-appstore/) compression option.
- If you’re doing IP-based geo-detection, you should always check if there is an `X-Forwarded-For` header. That way, you can also correctly locate browser users using proxy functionality, powered by Opera Mini and Opera Turbo.
- Opera Mini comes with “limited” standards support: this means that advanced JavaScript, CSS and other dynamic elements might not work as expected, due to the peculiarities of server-side rendering and limited client capabilities.
- Older Presto-powered Opera products that are no longer under active development, such as Opera 12 for computers, Opera Mobile Classic, etc. are not listed here.
