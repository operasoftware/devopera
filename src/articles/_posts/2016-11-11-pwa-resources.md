## Introduction

Want to get started with progressive web apps, but not sure where to start? This page will list the best resources we know of to help you understand Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), get started and learn things in depth.

Make sure to bookmark this page, as this is a living document that we’ll be adding to from time to time.

## Progressive Web Apps: The what, how and why

## UI Concepts

One of the best things about PWAs are that they can be added to the home screen of your Android device, just like native apps can. This section contains relevant articles covering the ‘Add to Home Screen’ capability, as well as a few articles on how to make your web app UI running smoothly.

## Offline

Progressive Web Apps are capable of running offline just like native apps. This is primarily through a feature called ‘Service Worker’. Service Workers are great, and besides being used to make web apps run offline, are also required for other functionality like Push Notifications and Background Sync.

## Push Notifications

Push notifications are helpful in notifying the user of important, relevant or timely events, even if your site isn’t open in the browser, or even when the browser is closed. With the Push API spec and Service Workers, you can finally implement this in your progressive web app too. Be careful not to spam your users!
